Maintenant traduis ça stp « I'm about to hit a million followers on Instagram, all without spending a dime on ads. When everyone else was chasing the algorithm, posting 10 times a day, I did something that most people would say is impossible. In this video, I'm going to show you the three systems across content, design, and funnels, and show you how each part of this Instagram flywheel feeds the next part to make things grow exponentially. Let's get into it. Part one, exponential content creation. The first part of the flywheel solves the biggest problem that every entrepreneur faces. How to go and create enough content without just becoming some creator that's stuck on the content hamster wheel. This is where most entrepreneurs get it wrong. They think they need to be creating content every single day. But sure enough, this is just a recipe for burnout. Now, the reality is there has to be a better way. And this is where the content waterfall system comes in. You know, just last month, I wrote a post on systems thinking, and that one core idea became a pillar piece of content in a YouTube video. I was then able to take clips from that and turn it into three Instagram reels, three Tik Tok posts, and three YouTube shorts, as well as a newsletter for six weeks later, three LinkedIn posts, and three X threads. This allows you to take one idea and repurpose it so you're not on the content hamster wheel. The key is having templates that never change so you can just keep on swapping out ideas and feeding them into the same formats. This is how you go and create content and become multiplied as a founder. All right. So, right here you can see that I have one LinkedIn post pulled up, right? I've hired 90 plus high performers in the last three years. Here are eight traits I see in every high performer. And so, into this post, I get into the eight core traits like grit, relentless resourcefulness, optimism, constant learning, not being an you know, being fun to be around, growth mindset, and enjoying responsibility. This one post was something that I woke up to on a Monday, had this idea for this post that I thought would be a banger, wrote it out, and that was that. Now, I'm going to show you how this one pillar piece of content for LinkedIn went and became 20 plus other pieces of content. So, here you can see on Instagram, we've taken that same piece of content from LinkedIn and then turned it into an Instagram carousel. And so, we have eight rare traits I see in every high performer. This is over 21,000 likes, over 9 million views, right? But it's the same content from LinkedIn. So, we've simply just repurposed this into a carousel and good to go. Right at the end of this, the cool thing, too, is that we use the many chat feature, which I'll show you here in just a couple minutes, to go and get people to comment the word coffee. And when they do that, there's an automation that happens in my DMs on Instagram that drives people from the DMs to a workshop that I'm running in about 10 days. So, from here, you can see same deal on X. Inside of X, I've gone and combined that same post with this really high value image that I had my team create. We posted this up and it generates another 250,000 views. Right? So, this is the power of the content waterfall, you know, in action. Right? You can see that that first post got around 3 million views, but the subsequent posts have gotten around 10x that. And so, it also becomes an X thread. This one in this case got 1.8 million views. And again, it's just that same content from LinkedIn. So, no more work on my side, no new content creation. It's simply just maximizing the content, time, and energy that I put into that original post and getting the maximum amount out of it. So, same deal here. This has now gone and become a community post on YouTube. It's also going to become a long- form YouTube video that you'll see coming out on my channel in the next few weeks. And then we also are able to go and repurpose it again on LinkedIn in around 3 months later. You know what you're seeing here is content multiplied. So the cool thing is is that you have an enormous amount of potential to use these kinds of systems when you have your template set up. You know I have templates for things like carousels on Instagram or the different ways that we do stories on Instagram so that I don't need to go and come up with new formats constantly. We can just reuse the stuff that we've seen work and then just sub in new content. This makes it easier for me to think about the content ideas I need to create because I know the format they're going to be in. It's also way easier for my designer Yan to go and then take my ideas and then format them into a way that we know will work. When you have formats that work, it just makes your life easier. But let me go and show you a little bit behind the scenes of the formats that I've seen work on Instagram over the last 90 days so you can go and use them for your account. All right, so here we are in my Instagram dashboard. We're looking at the insights over the last 90 days. And we'll rank my content by the most amount of views. And so here you can see some interesting patterns as to the kind of content that's performing best as well as the formats that are absolutely hitting on the platform. Here's an example. You can see that a lot of the different formats that are working are this one style of carousel. So again, it's pretty simple, right? It's just got the bits of advice over about eight slides. And then the final slide of the carousel then leads people to a DM automation getting them to go and comment 30 in this case to get my 30-day CEO transformation playbook. So when they comment 30 on the post, we then go and DM them a playbook and also get their phone number and email in exchange for that. These people then go and join the Foundest newsletter, which is the only newsletter to help you go and scale your personal brand. and inside of there, they may eventually become leads to my different portfolio companies. And so, this is not just how to grow your Instagram, but also how to drive from content all the way through to profit. So, in terms of some other patterns we can see here, first off, they're all carousels, right? Carousels are the core format that is blowing up on Instagram. Also, some of the key ways you can see I'm starting this content are with numbers like 8, 9, and 10. You can see a lot of them start with words like how to or how I. Most of these posts have some sort of number on that first slide. You can leverage this to go and use this sort of format for your own Instagram. I don't put much text on each slide. That way it's super scrollable. And our goal too is on each slide of the carousel to be making it where it's easy for someone to go and share that to their stories and it makes sense. It just results in more shares and more shares equal more virality. 4 hours a week can create content for your entire week. Here's how it breaks down. One hour is dedicated to actually going and planning out over 20 different hooks. From there, hours two and three can be spent actually filling in that content with the relevant, you know, systems, blueprints, playbooks, and deep dives. After that, you want to make sure that you have all the right CTA set up on the content so you can drive people from content to leads and then create any relevant lead magnets that are needed for those pieces of content so you're able to drive the leads through to the lead magnet and eventually sell those people. This is the content to revenue bridge and this is how you build your own profitable personal media company. Part two, magnetic brand design. Now, here's the part that separates successful accounts from everyone else just posting into the void. It's about getting people to actually stop the scroll and follow you. Most content gets scrolled past in just 0.3 seconds, but I'm going to show you how to actually go and stop the scroll. All right, so here we're going to go and open up my Instagram and I'm going to give you a bit of a deep dive as to how I look at things. Here you can see first off, clean profile picture and the oneliner proven systems to grow a profitable audience with content. So, it's super clear why you should follow me and what exactly I can help you with. From there, we have an automation set up via ManyHat, which I'll show you here in a second, that allows people to go and learn more about Founder OS and how they can scale their personal brand with us. Now, from there, you can see over the last 30 days, the strategy I'm showing you here has driven us over 34.9 million views. The cool thing there, too, is that we've done that all without spending a dime on ads. Now, the grid here kind of has this light, dark, light, dark sort of effect, right? And then you can see I'm using those Instagram insights we saw to go and make sure that you know each post and carousel has that white background, black text. I have a few different formats here, right? We have cut downs for my long form videos as one format. So this is a cool way of using that content waterfall system from a YouTube video and using those for cuts on our Instagram reels. We obviously have our carousel format which cranks and typically has eight slides with a call to action at the end. I then have raw videos where I just film these off of my iPhone, send it to my social team, and then use Instagram's edits functionality to just simply go and edit up a reel using the platform and then post it. Pro tip there is it's a lot better to go and actually edit your reels inside of Instagram because it's going to be more promoted via their algorithm. In addition to that, we like to go and create just other creative trending topics. So, I'll often times go and save different inspiration on Instagram into my different collections. So, you can see in my saved collections, I have a bunch here, right? But I have a whole brand collection that has a bunch of cool branded videos and such that have inspired me. And so, I'll often times use the inspiration in my different Instagram collections, we also have an OS content studios, Instagram messaging group where if I find different content or my team does that we really like, we may go and use those formats to go then and become different formats for our upcoming reels. You know, as a team, we're constantly going and sharing different stuff that we love. We're saving it to different collections. We have a weekly content meeting where we're all sharing different inspiration. And what this allows us to do is essentially just go and crowdsource the best formats and ideas. And so, it's basically 50% carousels and 50% reels. And this is what's allowed me to grow my followers upwards of 90,000 per month. Not every month, but that's many months. It just shows you the power of this content strategy. The truth is that taste is the ultimate competitive advantage. And in every nine parts of your grid on Instagram, you should be telling a complete story. You know, when you look at my grid, you can see that every piece of it is intentional. Three colors, two core formats, and one key message in everything that we do. When you go and hit my profile, about 20% of people on average go and then follow me. Compared to most accounts where it's just around 1%, so that's 20x more follows than the average person. You know, when you go and you communicate a clean brand, people can tell. It's kind of like, you know, a luxury brand, right? People really focus on things like being handmade, making sure there's a story and heritage behind it and that people can see the craftsmanship that went into every piece of it. You know, I approach Founder OS and my personal brand the same way. I want people to understand the story behind what we're building. This idea that, you know, we're trying to do for founders what, you know, Apple did for creatives in the 70s and Nike did for athletes in the 80s. I'd recommend making sure that you're intentional about every piece of content you create. For carousels, it's things like the copy on each slide, the design, the caption you put on it and the way that you run different automations on the platform. For things like stories, it's being authentic, showing behind the scenes, and giving people a glimpse into your actual life. For reals, it's being authentic, taking your phone, you don't need any fancy equipment, and just recording who you are, what you're up to, and taking pride in your hooks. Because if you can't go and nail the first 3 seconds, well, you're not going to capture anyone's attention. And I approached my Instagram grid with the same level of craftsmanship. You know, I want people to go and arrive on my profile and have an amazing first impression. Here's how to make your content so recognizable that they know it's yours before they even see your name. The key thing is to make sure, number one, that you have your formats nailed down. Number two is that you have a clean brand aesthetic that is visually appealing but also recognizable. For me, it's using the same font, the same colors, and making sure that I'm using the overall same content categories. Which leads me to the third part, which is that you should generally have some content buckets you go for. For me, it's things like, you know, helping founders with systems. It's personal stories, and then it's giving you organic content strategies. The three of these combined equal my brand online and the promise for why people should even follow me in the first place. It's one part value, one part storytelling, one part behind the scenes. And the merger of this is what builds my powerful personal brand. You know, in a world where people are posting stuff all of the time, you know, it's important that you actually take a step back and try to define, you know, what your brand aesthetic is and how you're going to stand out versus other people. I think there are a few awesome tools for this, including Cosmos, Pinterest, and my mind. You know, these tools allow you to go and save some beautiful designs and concepts all across the internet so that the next time you're looking to go and evolve your brand, first off, you can go and create your own brand mood board. You know, when you've created your brand mood board, you're thinking about images, colors, videos that encapsulate the general vibe you're going for. This is what then translates into the formats you create. So, let's break down this aesthetic and how it all comes together. Well, first off, I'm going to bring you into our company, Figma. Now, Figma is a design tool that allows you to go and organize all of your design resources in your company and then share them and work on them as a team. And so, here we have as an example our grid preview, right? This is typically what our grid will look something like a mix of amazing photos, videos, and carousels. And so, here you can also see it kind of has that light and dark pattern, right? So that it just visually looks stimulating. We also have sort of a photo or video and then carousel pattern so it all looks consistent. And as you scroll the feed, you can tell it's intentionally put together. When it comes to the carousels themselves, we have guidelines for all of this stuff. Again, intentionality is everything. So, here's a bit of the anatomy of our paper carousels. First off, we have a background with blurred text. It has that paper texture, right? So there's different irregularly shaped backgrounds of that blurred out paper so that you know it looks like there's a real book you're reading in a way that has that kind of translucent effect. We then have the keyword of the hook always in italic and bold right so in this case how to make your personal brand uncopyable that uncopyable word we highlight it. In addition to that, you can see that we always go and put the text in a minimal looking way, centering it inside of the carousel, right? So that there's a title, there's a body, and we will bold any key phrase. This makes it highly sharable where people can't help but go and share an individual slide to their stories, only further boosting that carousel in Instagram's algorithm. There's a lot of science behind this art as you can see. From there, we also love to go and sprinkle in these minimalist graphics, things like graphs, charts, different illustrations to kind of mix it up a bit. And so, it's not just our carousels, right? We have, you know, Google Docs as well. You know, for each of our carousels, we often times go and have a lead magnet that we give at the end of them. The lead magnet people get by going and putting in a certain keyword in the comments, and then we go and DM them that via many chat. I at this point have created over 140 lead magnets over the last 2 years. Everything from hiring to a CEO scorecard to creating an intentional content on things like YouTube and LinkedIn. And so it's these lead magnets that actually currently drive around 80% of the revenue to Founder OS, which is pretty nuts. You wouldn't imagine it, but things like Google Docs and Google Slides can be that powerful. Here you can see a wall of these paper carousels. You know, we make a lot of these. About three per week, you know, 12 per month. and it's a high-erforming content format. Let's move on to another format here. In this case, you can see this different sort of texture which is just kind of more of like an old vintage paper sort of texture. Okay, we've gone and we've curated different references from Pinterest that we really liked and then leveraged these to create our own format. In this case, you know, we have these carousels that are kind of on a crinkled piece of paper that follow more or less the same pattern I just showed you. In addition to that, you know, we're showing my key framework. So, the key thing here is not just the design in terms of the visuals. It's also the design as it pertains to the copy. It's clear, not clever. It's at an eighth grade reading level. I'm making sure that I'm making content that's super simple. So, I'm describing complex ideas in a simple way so it's highly sharable. And we're breaking it down in ways that you can understand it simply using systems, rhythms, blueprints, things that will allow you to package it up nicely and be able to tell it to your friend in a way that just makes sense. We always always at the end of these carousels have, you know, a lead magnet that we give away so that again we're being insanely generous with our content. My hope is that below a given carousel people go and comment, I can't believe this is free and we make it impossible for them to not share it, you know, with 10 of their friends. And that's what success looks like. So, let's move on to the different story formats that we have here as well. Okay, so when it comes to stories, those are a little bit different. The key thing I do here is often times is take photos when I'm out and about in different cities. I save those to my camera roll and every Friday I do a mass upload to my Slack to my designer and my social media manager so they can go and post these throughout the week. The key thing is that you want to give people a little bit of behind the scenes as to what you're up to. And so here you can see different examples of, you know, posts around the founder hikes that we do all around the world. In this case, we're inviting people to go and do a founder hike in Lisbon. When they go and comment hike here, we then add them to a WhatsApp group, then drop an alltrails location to an upcoming hike that we have. In addition to that, we also have these kind of raw stories that I also do to promote different YouTube videos as they come out. We publish YouTube videos every Tuesday and every Friday. Core systems that I use to run my portfolio of online businesses. And a big promotion engine for those YouTube videos is Instagram. This is the powerful thing about having an omniresent content strategy is that you can be using the growth on your Instagram to help feed the other platforms that you exist on. In addition to that, you know, you can also see that, you know, we're going and sharing again YouTube videos in different formats. One thing I've learned here is that when you share YouTube videos, it's good to really sell people on the exact concept and what they can find in it because you're not just trying to drive the click. You want to actually drive watch time of that video as well. If you're just driving people and then they bounce on the YouTube video, it may actually cause it to get worse performance. So, little insider tip there. So, here's a little bit more of the inside scoop of how we got my profile to over 950,000 followers. In the background here, right, you can see some of our top performing formats. And the cool thing is, right, that these all look relatively the same today. You can see the strategy, you know, alone from these carousels is driving over 14 million views and our account is growing at over 58% month over month. Part three, connecting content to revenue. But even if you master the last system, this is where millions of beautiful Instagram accounts go to die because they get millions of followers but make zero dollars. And so I'm going to show you how to go and fix that. Go and survey people that are your customers and ask them things like, "What's your biggest goal this year? What's your biggest challenge? And if I could wave a magic wand, what problem would you want me to help you with?" From there, you can go and get a list of stuff and say a type form, upload it to chatbt and say, "Hey, go and create a 100 content ideas in how-to formats and how I formats that go and solve these core problems for my dream customer." The key thing here is that we're actually going and helping people with the stuff that they genuinely care about. And when your content solves that, it's only natural that they go and then go and work with you. Let me show you how I go and connect engagement on Instagram with real revenue and a real sales process. So, what I'm going to share with you is one of the most powerful systems that lives inside of my Instagram. It's called Many Chat. It allows us to collect information, emails, phone numbers, and then send followers free value. This is how I've grown an insane audience through automations. And what I'm going to go is break down the exact automation flow for you here. Now, one of the main thing I want to show you here is our DM center, right? This is where we go and have all of our different automations and give away all of the free resources that you see on my Instagram carousels. There's two kinds of resources here. Ones that add value and then ones that add visibility. And I'm going to break them down for you a bit here. These are all of the free systems that I give away on my Instagram. We organize them into a folder called free resources. And then inside of that, you can go and see a lot of the best resources like, you know, my 1% CEO transformation systems. This is also where I give my 21 days of profit acceleration email course, my 7-day AI email course. It all happens via these automations. First thing here is that the user engages with our content, right? Via a comment or a DM from there. Then when they comment the word 50, that keyword then is a trigger for the free resource. So, we have triggers for a ton of different stuff like 15, 30, free, you name it. It triggers different lead magnets in different automations in ManyHat. What we then do is then have a welcome message that people get. That welcome message also goes and tags that lead, gives them the resource, and then also make sure they're added to our CRM and HubSpot so that a lead is linked with a core resource that they came in from, which allows us to then register them in a way that we can then have that data to market to them in new and interesting ways, knowing the kinds of stuff that they're into. So, in this case, someone's really into systems and personal branding. So, we're going to go and give them access to that free resource once they've gone and given us their email and potentially their phone number. So, from there, there are different pathways people go, right? The first step is that they want the resource and we give it to them and they go down that path. The second path is that they say that they're not interested and then the whole automation just stops. The second step then is once the user has engaged, we then give them the content and they're actually going to go and get this whole resource which typically is it either in a Google doc or in Google Slides. All along the way, we're tagging different people, right? So, this is all getting organized into a robust way, but it also feels very organic and super human, right? We're making sure that the messages are actually handcrafted by me so that they sound like me. So, we're trying to give an insane amount of generosity, make it feel human, while also going and showcasing the power of our automations and systems. And so, if a founder goes and wants a given lead magnet, they just click yes. We'll send it over to their email and voila, they have it. You know, I think that so many people go and treat their audience just like some number. And we want to go and treat each person in my audience as if it was our best friend. really helping them out, helping them overcome challenges and obstacles and make sure that every interaction that we have with them dazzles them. I think when you stack this up over years, that's how you create a brand that matters. The metrics most people care about have zero correlation with actually driving revenue. But these three metrics I'm about to show you are the ones that actually matter. This is going to show you the difference between content ROI and just some vanity metrics. So, first off, you want to look at email signups per post. You know, we go and track this all through HubSpot so we can understand via HubSpot and Many Chat which carousels we're putting out drive the most leads. You know, inevitably you want your content to convert to your owned audience because you don't own Instagram, but you should own a newsletter and each post should be driving folks to that list. So that is metric number one. Your second metric is your revenue per follower. You know, you should know your cash collection per month per platform and then be able to know which posts are driving you the most revenue. You can easily do this when you have the right tagging system on the back end in Many Chat in HubSpot. You know, we use HubSpot as our core CRM inside of Founder OS. It allows us to tag different people based on where they came in. This allows us not just to understand our profit per subscriber, but also understand which content is converting best so that we can go and double down on those content topics. You also want to know your Instagram conversion rate from traffic, right? Of the amount of traffic you're driving from Instagram, how many of those people are becoming customers? Where this becomes interesting is that let's just say in June you were pursuing one content strategy and you change that up a little bit in August. Well, it would be nice to know that based on the amount of traffic that you drove to your website or to your apply page or a landing page, how much of that traffic actually converted and which strategy was more efficient with the traffic. So, when you understand conversion rates, you can understand and make tweaks to your content, to your topics, and your overall approach. Part four, building a team. Here's the bottleneck that kills most companies before they even start gaining momentum. You need to get the right team on board in the right order. Here's why the fastest growing accounts aren't run by the hardest working founders. They're run by the smartest hiring founders. One of the biggest things you can do if you're looking to grow your account is get great at delegating. The reality is is that you shouldn't just be building a personal brand. You need to be building a personal media company and moving from the creator behind your brand to the CEO. So, this all comes down to then having the right people in the right seats. First off, it's having a social media manager on board to help be that head of distribution, making sure that you're putting the right content in the right format at the right time of the day with the right caption so you don't have to have your finger on the trigger 7 days a week and can instead be getting some support. From there, you're probably going to want to go and bring on a designer. Generally around 3K per month, this is the person that's going to help make your account and your grid visually stunning. The next aspect then is an editor. You know, going and creating reels every day takes a hell of a lot of time. And video editors, they're maestros at this. So, you can get generally going with someone for around $3 to $5,000 per month and actually have someone professional going and helping you make your reels and your videos dialed in for performance. you know, this team, you're kind of looking at 10 to 12K per month, which a lot of founders could look at and go, "Damn, that's expensive." But the thing is this, right? You got to look at everything as an investment. Now, if the average customer to you is worth $10,000 of profit per year, and your team costs between 10 to 12K, if that whole team brings on one incremental customer per month, they pay for themselves. So, the reality is, it's actually pretty insane not to get the right team in place, and you're leaving a ton of money on the table if you don't. All right, I'm going to go and show you how to go and determine whether that next hire you're going to make is actually going to make you money or just cost you a bunch of money. So, this is my delegation math calculator, and you go and find this resource via the link in the description. And here is how it works. So, let's just say we're going to go and hire a social media manager, and that person is going to go and cost us $7,000 a month as an example. Okay, now hold your horses here. We don't know if this person actually makes sense because it's not about looking at the expense. It's about looking at the return on investment, which is what this calculator is all about. Let's just say that your revenue per hour, okay, if you are not focused on posting content, but instead we're on sales calls, let's just say that, you know, the revenue that you would generate per hour yourself is 2,000 bucks. Okay? And let's just say that that social media manager is going to save you around 20 hours a week or 80 hours a month. Well, lastly, let's just say the profit margin of what you're building is 50%. Here we can see this delegation math in motion. Okay. When you go and you reallocate those 80 hours a week that you're saving to actually going and generating that $2,000 per hour that you're worth, that's $160,000 of incremental revenue a month. At a 50% margin, that's $80,000 of profit. That is money on the table that you are leaving by doing all of this social media manager work that's candidly just below your hourly rate. So, the profit after the hire, which is 80K minus 7K, is $73,000, which is a 10.4x ROI on that $7,000 social media manager salary. This is how you think about building your team, which is going and stacking your team with hires that have an insane ROI and delegating the stuff that you should not be working on, so you can double down on the stuff that only you can do. This is the kind of stuff that we actually give founders inside of Founder OS. You know, we have all the core systems for X, for LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, and also for building your personal media company. And what I'm going to give you is some of the core systems for things like the social media manager scorecard, how to go and hire your own chief of staff, how to go and hire a designer with that scorecard, as well as a copywriter scorecard. And you can go and find all four of these inside of the description below and go and download them. If you're looking to go and get more systems just like this, you should definitely consider joining Founder OS. You'll get access to me, my seuite, join founder retreats we host all around the world and be able to hop on daily calls with my team to help get you the support you need as you're building your own personal media company. You can go and check it out and apply via the link in the description. But here's what separates the people that actually build this from the people that are just going to go watch this video and do nothing. It all comes down to taking real action. Here's the good news. I've gone and synthesized every blueprint, automation, and playbook that you've seen in this video and put it into my Instagram flywheel blueprint, which you can go and get via the link in the description. I want to see you take massive action, build your personal media company, and grow an amazing audience on your Instagram. I can't wait to see what you create. »
ChatGPT a dit :
Bien sûr 🙂 Voici la traduction complète en français, fidèle au sens et au ton :

Je suis sur le point d’atteindre un million d’abonnés sur Instagram, sans avoir dépensé un seul centime en publicité. Pendant que tout le monde courait après l’algorithme et publiait 10 fois par jour, j’ai fait quelque chose que la plupart des gens considèrent comme impossible.
Dans cette vidéo, je vais te montrer trois systèmes — le contenu, le design et les tunnels de conversion — et comment chaque partie de ce flywheel Instagram alimente la suivante pour créer une croissance exponentielle.
C’est parti.

Partie 1 : la création de contenu exponentielle
La première partie du flywheel résout le plus gros problème auquel chaque entrepreneur est confronté :
comment créer suffisamment de contenu sans devenir un créateur coincé dans la roue du hamster du contenu.

C’est là que la majorité des entrepreneurs se trompent. Ils pensent devoir créer du contenu tous les jours. Mais en réalité, c’est la recette parfaite pour le burnout.
Il doit forcément exister une meilleure façon de faire. Et c’est là qu’intervient le système de la cascade de contenu (content waterfall).

Le mois dernier, par exemple, j’ai écrit un post sur la pensée systémique. Cette idée centrale est devenue un contenu pilier pour une vidéo YouTube.
À partir de là, j’ai pu en extraire :

3 Reels Instagram

3 posts TikTok

3 YouTube Shorts

une newsletter publiée six semaines plus tard

3 posts LinkedIn

3 threads sur X

Tout cela à partir d’une seule idée.
L’objectif est simple : ne plus être prisonnier de la roue du hamster du contenu.

La clé, ce sont des templates qui ne changent jamais. Tu remplaces uniquement les idées, que tu injectes dans les mêmes formats encore et encore.
C’est comme ça que tu crées du contenu en étant multiplié en tant que fondateur.

Prenons un exemple concret.
Voici un post LinkedIn que j’ai écrit :

« J’ai recruté plus de 90 top performers ces trois dernières années. Voici 8 traits que je retrouve chez chacun d’eux. »

Je parle de traits comme la résilience, la débrouillardise, l’optimisme, l’apprentissage constant, le fait d’être agréable à côtoyer, le growth mindset et le sens des responsabilités.

J’ai eu cette idée un lundi matin, je l’ai écrite, publiée… et c’est tout.
Maintenant, je vais te montrer comment ce seul post LinkedIn est devenu plus de 20 contenus différents.

Sur Instagram, ce même contenu est devenu un carousel :

« 8 traits rares que je retrouve chez chaque top performer »

Résultat :

plus de 21 000 likes

plus de 9 millions de vues

C’est exactement le même contenu. On l’a simplement reformatté.

À la fin du post, on utilise aussi ManyChat : on demande aux gens de commenter le mot coffee.
Quand ils le font, une automatisation se déclenche dans mes DM Instagram et les redirige vers un workshop que j’organise dans une dizaine de jours.

Même chose sur X :
On reprend le post LinkedIn, on l’associe à une image à forte valeur créée par mon équipe → 250 000 vues supplémentaires.

Puis ça devient aussi un thread X : 1,8 million de vues.
Encore une fois, aucun nouveau contenu, juste de la maximisation.

Ensuite :

un post communauté sur YouTube

une future vidéo YouTube long format

un repost LinkedIn environ 3 mois plus tard

Ce que tu vois ici, c’est du contenu multiplié.

Quand tu as des templates qui fonctionnent :

tu sais à l’avance dans quel format ton idée va vivre

ton designer peut exécuter plus vite

ta vie devient beaucoup plus simple

Voici maintenant les formats qui ont le mieux performé sur Instagram sur les 90 derniers jours.

Tous les contenus les plus performants sont :

des carousels

avec des chiffres (8, 9, 10…) sur la première slide

souvent des accroches du type « Comment… » ou « Comment j’ai… »

Peu de texte par slide → très scrollable → plus de partages.
Plus de partages = plus de viralité.

4 heures par semaine pour créer tout ton contenu
1 heure : brainstormer plus de 20 hooks

2–3 heures : remplir le contenu (systèmes, frameworks, playbooks)

Ensuite : CTA + lead magnets pour transformer le contenu en leads

C’est le pont entre le contenu et le revenu.
C’est comme ça que tu construis une entreprise média personnelle rentable.

Partie 2 : un design de marque magnétique
C’est ce qui sépare les comptes qui réussissent de ceux qui postent dans le vide.

Tout commence par :

une photo de profil claire

une promesse limpide dans la bio

une automatisation qui explique immédiatement comment travailler avec toi

En 30 jours, cette stratégie nous a généré 34,9 millions de vues, sans aucune publicité.

Le feed est intentionnel :

clair / foncé / clair / foncé

50 % carousels, 50 % reels

mêmes couleurs, mêmes polices, mêmes formats

Résultat : jusqu’à 90 000 nouveaux abonnés par mois.

Quand quelqu’un arrive sur mon profil, 20 % des visiteurs me suivent.
La moyenne est autour de 1 %.

Le goût est l’avantage compétitif ultime.

Chaque 9 posts de ton feed doivent raconter une histoire complète.
Tout est intentionnel : couleurs, formats, message.

Comme une marque de luxe, les gens sentent le niveau de soin et de craftsmanship.

Reconnaissable avant même de voir ton nom
Formats clairs

Esthétique cohérente

3 piliers de contenu

Pour moi :

systèmes pour fondateurs

storytelling personnel

stratégies de croissance organique

Valeur + storytelling + coulisses = marque personnelle puissante.

Partie 3 : connecter le contenu au revenu
C’est ici que meurent des millions de comptes Instagram magnifiques :
beaucoup d’abonnés, zéro chiffre d’affaires.

Je sonde mes clients :

Quel est ton objectif principal ?

Ton plus gros défi ?

Quel problème veux-tu que je résolve ?

Je transforme ces réponses en idées de contenu.
Quand ton contenu résout de vrais problèmes, vendre devient naturel.

Automatisations & ManyChat
Chaque commentaire déclenche :

un DM

un lead magnet

collecte email + téléphone

tagging CRM (HubSpot)

J’ai créé plus de 140 lead magnets en 2 ans.
Ils génèrent aujourd’hui 80 % du chiffre d’affaires de Founder OS.

On traite chaque abonné comme un ami proche.
Sur le long terme, c’est comme ça qu’on construit une marque qui compte.

Les 3 métriques qui comptent vraiment
Emails générés par post

Revenu par abonné

Taux de conversion Instagram → client

Les vanity metrics ne payent pas les factures.

Partie 4 : construire une équipe
Les comptes qui explosent ne sont pas gérés par les fondateurs les plus travailleurs, mais par les plus intelligents dans leurs recrutements.

Tu dois passer de créateur à CEO d’une entreprise média personnelle.

Équipe minimale :

Social media manager

Designer (~3k/mois)

Vidéo editor (3–5k/mois)

Coût : 10–12k/mois
Mais si un seul client vaut 10k/an, l’équipe est déjà rentable.

Le vrai calcul, c’est le ROI de la délégation.

Si tu veux tous ces systèmes :

scorecards de recrutement

playbooks

automatisations

frameworks

Ils sont tous disponibles dans Founder OS et dans le Instagram Flywheel Blueprint.

Mais la vraie différence entre ceux qui réussissent et ceux qui regardent juste la vidéo, c’est l’action.

J’ai hâte de voir ce que tu vas créer 🚀

Vous avez dit :
Traduis ça maintenant « if I had to start an Instagram account from scratch zero zilch NADA this would be my exact plan to hit 10,000 followers as fast as possible I'm talking step by step what I recommend doing on day one day two and so on not only have I grown my own Instagram account but I've worked with hundreds of students helping them grow I audit my students Instagram accounts every week and these are the changes that one must commit to if you're serious about growing as always time stamp and resources are below grab a pen and paper let's jump in day one set up your account for a high follower conversion rate what is a follower conversion rate and how can you set up your account to get followers from the very beginning your follower conversion rate is the percentage of people who decide to follow you after they've visited your profile so if 100 people visit your profile you want as many of them to press that follow Button as possible if zero of them follow you that's an indication that something about your profile itself is off and needs to be fixed to set up your account for a high follower conversion rate all you have to do is remember PBC positioning branding and clear bio call to action and category for positioning what type of content will you be creating and who is your content going to be for you have to know the answers to those questions if you can't clearly answer those questions then Instagram's algorithm is going to have a really hard time connecting your content to the right people here's proof from Instagram themselves that this is what you have to do to see success on their platform in a meta article titled powered by AI Instagram's explor recommender system they say by building account embeddings we're able to more efficiently identify which accounts are topically similar to each other Instagram's algorithm first assigns a topic to your profile if they can not identify one topic for you you will likely be posting for years and see very very slow if any traction at all unfortunately I've seen this happen time and time again to creators who are truly amazing talented but they don't want to pick one topic they're posting in so many different topics lifestyle if you want to call it that and they post for years and years and they're stuck at the same number it's because they refuse to pick a topic so if you want to scale and grow quickly you have to pick one topic then once Instagram can identify what topic your account falls under what happens next they say in that same article by applying the same techniques from their embedding framework we can predict accounts with which a person is likely to interact in a given session within the Instagram app AKA then they can start recommending your content to different people on the app that are interested in your specific topic this is why everybody says to Niche down on Instagram because their algorithm is literally designed to favor accounts who have one clear Niche and if you don't want to Niche down that's okay that's fine just go to Tik Tok instead don't be on Instagram but if you're dead set on Instagram you have to Niche down so for the example in this video let's say that I'm setting up my account from zero let's do my positioning together what type of content will I be creating AKA what topic am I going to create in running let's say I'm going to create a running account who will that content be for I could see myself creating running content for beginners or people who want to start their running Journey too and maybe don't have any experience now it's your turn pause this video write down your answers to those two questions because if you clearly can't answer those two questions then Instagram's algorithm won't be able to either next in PBC we have the B which is branding this is where you're going to communicate your positioning through the app the photo username and name plate mainly for now my positioning is posting running content for beginners so how can I make that clear through my profile photo through maybe my username and especially my name plate with your profile photo you want to make sure that it is a clear representation of you with great lighting if you could match your photo to your Niche great so if I'm in the running space it would be cool to have a picture of me running or in running gear maybe Outdoors something that makes sense for the content that I'm posting while your username doesn't have to be so Niche specific like I don't have to say running with Millie I could just say Millie Adrien you know it could be my name you still want your username to be simple easy to remember and easy to spell then the most important part is the name plate this is the Bold section of your profile the reason this is so important is because this section is actually the most searchable on Instagram so if I were to go to Instagram right now and type in running coach or running tips anyone with that phrase in their name plate in the Bold part of their name will show up in my search results so ask yourself how do I want people to find me how do I want to be identified what are some Search terms that my audience might be typing into the search bar that I could put in the Bold part so I'm more discoverable we have my profile photo set up nice running pick we have my hand let's go with running with Millie and for my name plate I'm going to put Millie running for beginners then finally the final letter in PBC is our C which is really three different C's we have clear bio category and call to action the bio is where a lot of people mess up and they make it about them they're like oh I'm from San Diego or like they put like Pinterest quotes and they're like follow your joy not me making fun of my own quote that would not be a good bio and your bio is actually like a strong selling point to increase your follower conversion so your bio is actually going to be why somebody should follow you you're going to communicate the type of content that they can expect from you or what they will gain when they press that follow button you're basically telling them hey if you follow me this is what I will do for you this is how I'm going to show up for you this is what you will learn this is what you will gain so let's set up my bio I would probably say something like helping beginner Runners start their Journey with practical tips and daily motivation you know it could be as simple as that but that clearly tells them hey if you are a beginner Runner and you want tips and inspiration you're going to want to press that follow button your category is something that you could select when setting up your profile because again it helps Instagram understand what your account is about literally under categories they say categories help people find accounts like yours so if there's a category that represents your Niche definitely use that and then finally CTA our strong call to action I recommend every content creator has a call to action leading their followers someplace else I'm bias I am always going to encourage creators even if you're starting from zero create a freebie get them onto your email list make a digital product you know like take them somewhere that's beneficial to you and your business as you grow not just oh follow my YouTube go check out my Tik Tok not just things like that so this is going to lead me to what I would do on day two and that that is create a money magnet technically this step is optional depending on what your specific goals are with Instagram for me I know when I was starting an Instagram account my end goal was to make money I wanted to be able to monetize being a content creator so if that's also you then I would do this step basically what we're going to be doing is setting up one stream of passive income now so that as your account grows your income is growing with you this is something that does not have to be hard to do at all all you have to do is pick some sort of low ticket offer that you think your ideal follower would find valuable for example I'm creating running content targeted towards beginners I'm going to start thinking about how can I monetize that a few options I could offer one-on-one coaching if I'm qualified to do that I could create a guide or downloadable with running plans maybe like a0 to 5K done for you running plan or even a 30-day running check challenge if teaching and educating isn't the direction that I want to go maybe I want to start a membership which can act as like a virtual run Club if I'm already running every week it would be fun to have a membership where once a week I'm like all right everybody this is our run together let's take pictures let's share our Journeys with each other how far did we run today you know just having a virtual run Club could be fun or I could create more of like a running Essentials guide where I list out all the essential products that you would need to get started and throughout your running journey and all those products are linked to affiliate links literally just start exploring all the different ways that you could provide something of value and sell it to a future audience if your answer is oh I don't really think there's a way to monetize this or to monetize or sell anything or to create anything you probably have some sort of limiting money belief happening because there is always a way if you don't know what to sell you could one look at other people in your industry other creator is in your Niche check out their links in BIO check out to see how they're making money and see if there's anything you can Implement too or to you can literally ask chat GPT I know so many people refuse to use AI but I love chat GPT chat GPT is so cool you can literally be like hey I'm a content creator I create running content to encourage beginners how to I want to create a low ticket digital product what should I create give me a list of 25 digital product ideas that I could start selling to my audience for $10 for $47 right like give it as much information as possible ask it to come up with a list of digital product ideas for you and it will spit out that list once you have a product or some sort of idea for how you want to monetize as you grow the setup for it is super simple all you have to do is set up a stand store Stan literally lets you monetize in almost every thinkable way as a content creator so stand store acts as your link in BIO whether you're going to start a membership sell a digital product sell an online course offer one-on-one coaching no matter what it is you can set that up on your stand store and have everything be handled paid directly through there there's like little to no Tech involvement needed at all so what I would do I would create my digital product in canva once I have it finished I'm going to export it as a PDF head over to my stand store create a new product select the digital product option and then fill in my digital product info going to give it a good title good description I'm going to say how much it's going to be let's say it's $27 I'm going to upload that PDF right there and publish it onto my stand store then going to go back a step we're going to add our call to action to our bio saying download your 0 to 5K running plan here then when people click on my link in BIO they could easily purchase the product right there one click of a button it is that simple I love Stan I'm obsessed I've been obsessed for years I'm very excited to say that this video is sponsored by Stan I've been talking about them for forever without them sponsoring my content so I'm stoked to be able to work with them a little bit closer so if you want to set up your own stand store I'll be sure to leave a link down below okay now that your account is officially set up to convert followers and sales it's time to move on to day three day three you're going to preload your content Bank this day is about 1 starting to create your content Bank AKA The Never Ending list of video ideas that you could pull from for when you you choose to film and two choosing your first nine videos to prepare before you post let's create our content bank for the time being we will be focusing on reals if your goal is growth focus on reals for the time being that's because reals is the only piece of content that was created with the algorithm and intention to reach new people Instagram has said time and time again that reals is to help you reach new eyes so in the beginning focus on reals don't worry about photos carousels Etc what you're going to do is open Instagram search and type in the type of content you're going to be creating in my case it is running we're going to just take a look at what those other suggested Search terms are we see running tips running motivation running outfits anything that feels in alignment with the type of content you're going to create just select it I'm going to take a look at running tips we're going to make sure we're studying just reals here and as we scroll we're going to look at some of the most popular viral reels and save some of the most popular viral ones to a folder to analyze and maybe recreate later this folder I'm going to create is going to be running tips and again I'm going to just save some of the most popular reels to this folder if you want to take an extra step you can make sure that you're only saving recent reels as opposed to Reels that are showing up from like over a year ago so if you could save reels within the past 3 months that are performing well you're going to have recent proof of what is currently working in your industry after I finish going through those reels I'm going to go back to ser search and do the same thing again with those other suggested terms so now instead of running tips I'm going to take a look at running outfits create a new folder start saving some videos there I could do this with the suggested search results or other ideas that I have so if I don't see running gear I can still type in running gear and look for the top performing videos there save we're just kind of going into batch save mode finding videos that we like ooh I like that that makes sense for me let me recreate that later and just saving them to folders after about 30 minutes of building up all this inspiration you're going to go to your saved folders look through all of them and you're going to pick nine videos to be your first nine that you post the first nine does not have to be perfect no no no no that's not where we're going for here we are simply finding nine different video types to create and test so one video that you're going to create in your first nine is going to be a talking head video maybe another video from the first nine is more of a voiceover video another one could be trending audio where there's Just b-roll Happening another one could be a lip sync video where you kind of lip sync what the audio is saying and then add some relatable text you could also play around with delivering different types of value in your content so one video in the first nine could be educational one video could be more inspirational another one could be focused on entertainment maybe kind of like a more run with me Vlog and another one could be more like that lip sync with the relatable text you just want to have as much Variety in your first night nine as possible to one push your boundaries a little bit challenge yourself as a Creator create content that you wouldn't normally create but also two test to see what's going to work well in your industry for you what feels good to create and you're just going to be in like test mode as you're going through your folders and you're finding videos that are like ooh this would be a good one for my first nine you could add it to any sort of content calendar or Notes app that you want so that you could keep track of like okay these are the first nine videos that I'm going to film a lot of people like to use Notes app when I was a solopreneur I was a DieHard Trello fan right now I'm using clickup because I have a team but find something that works for you where you can keep track of all the videos you'll be working on if you've learned something new so far be sure to give this video a thumbs up because then YouTube can push this video to other creators like yourself who might find this valuable and if you learn two new things by the end of this video consider subscribing it's a great way to support me my channel helps encourage me to continue to create free content like this for you every week now for day four I'm going to focus on batch filming as many videos as I can day five is when I'm going to batch edit when you are filming and editing your video the one thing that I'll say here is to make sure you implement hook layering I don't want to spend too much time on this because I already have a video that covers hook layering in depth but to see the best results with short form content these days you really need to master the art of a good hook and not just a good hook but hook hook layering hook layering is when you layer multiple types of hooks within the first 3 seconds of your video you have the text hook which is the text that appears on screen of your reel at the very beginning the audible hook which is what somebody hears at the beginning of the video and the visual hook which is what the person actually sees when watching your video If You Could Implement all three of those things really really well you are golden you are winning you have really mastered The Hook and the Art of short form content again I'm kind of brazing over filming and editing because I kind of want to keep this video as strategy focused as possible and I already have lots of videos talking about hook layering and I also have a video talking about how to film and edit aesthetic reels so I'll be sure to link them all the places card above description below so that you could watch those videos next for a further Deep dive on those day six we're going to prep our drafts this is where we're getting ideally our first nine in to Instagram in the drafts with the text with the captions with everything set and ready to post first thing you're going to do when you have a video uploaded to your drafts is to save the backup I cannot tell you how many times I've had students be like oh my gosh Instagram just deleted all of my drafts and I'm like yeah that happens sometimes so save your video even if it's like perfect you're going to post it in an hour just save a backup without the audio that's fine do that next let's talk about captions with your captions again if you're your goal is growth you want to put in as many keywords as possible yes there are creators that have fun in the captions and say things like Ang anyone else relate I've done that but if you're trying to grow quicker you want to help feed the algorithm what your video is going to be about so if the video you created was inspired by the Instagram search phrase running tips make sure you use that phrase in your caption in your popup text and maybe even your hashtags this is important because not only does this help Instagram understand what type of content you're creating and know who to push your content to but it also helps potentially rank your content in Instagram search so if I go to Instagram search and I look up sourdough bread if a video has sourdough bread with pop-up text or in the captions they're going to pop up in my search results because that Creator was very intentional with summarizing what that video was going to be about they utilized SEO as part of their strategy so try to be as intentional with keywords as possible if this whole keywords thing is confusing to you again I have a video teaching about Instagram SEO so go watch that video next since I did touch on hashtags what I would say for my strategy if I was starting from zero I would have zero hashtag strategy I would not care I would not care I would ignore them I don't care I would spend maybe 10 seconds being like um hash running tips # Amazon running gear hash running done how long was that what was the timer that's how long I would spend worrying about hashtags because Instagram themselves have said before time and time again hashtags do not help with growth they do not help getting you followers it is just an extra tool that you could use but is not the Make It or Break It point it's just not so I wouldn't even worry about hashtags other than 20 seconds of thinking about them truly with your cover photo on your reals I would make sure that all of my cover photos clearly explain what that real is going to be about that way when somebody lands on my profile their first impression with my first nine they see exactly five running tips for beginners how to breathe while running they see exactly what each real is and they know exactly the type of content that I will be delivering therefore it increases that follower conversion rate even more because there is so much Clarity behind the content that I'm creating so yes be intentional with your cover photos make sure the text is easy to read especially from the feed view with our drafts prepared now and a backlog of ideas ready for you to film how often should you post day seven let's talk about start your posting schedule the goal is to post as often as possible without getting burnt out obviously we know the more you post the more likely you'll grow quicker but longevity is more important going viral rapidly yeah great woo love that but what's more important for being a content creator is finding a schedule that is realistic for for you to keep up with for 2 years if you want to grow on Instagram be an Instagram Creator you got to keep it up you don't just do it for 2 months and be like wo I did it and then never post again you have to find a rhythm and a way to create on a consistent hamster wheel that doesn't burn you out in a way that matches your life and your unique lifestyle that you have even Adam aeri head of Instagram has emphasized this and it's funny because he was directly asked how often should I post and he doesn't give you a number I don't think it's because he's ignoring hey you should post this much I think he just doesn't want to say an unrealistic number for some people and then they burn themselves out because there's truly no magic number it's do what works for you for me on my it's Modern Millie account I post three times a week but we're talking about our running account today our running account that we're creating let's say also for that account I only want to post three times a week Monday Wednesday Friday that works well for me that means that's three posts a week if I have my first nine created I'm actually set for 3 weeks 3 6 9 I'm set for 3 weeks now I could go in and schedule those reels to autopost for me or just post live every morning Monday Wednesday Friday which actually gets you better results for me I've tested Auto posting and posting live and I feel like posting live my engagement is always better now days 8 through 14 you're going to be mastering the hamster wheel now that you have started posting in order to maintain whatever schedule you've created you have to master that content creator hamster wheel because it never stops you got to keep posting and you got to find a system that works for you if you were able to easily batch nine videos in a day after doing your content research maybe that's your routine maybe every other week is batching nine videos if that did not work out for you the first time around and you're like I did not batch nine videos I got three done that's fine you tested you tried to see what you were capable of for that day three videos in a batch session works for you great ask yourself should I do batch sessions once a week maybe twice a week continue to test and see how content creation can fit into your day-to-day lifestyle if you want to be a day-to-day content creator day 15 learn from the data and level up your strategy I put this at day 15 but you might not have enough analytics yet depending on how often you're posting ideally day whatever you're going to analyze the first nine after they've been posted you're going to study three signals in your insights likes shares and watch time with watch time actually being the most valuable signal I feel like everybody says oh Instagram says shares is the most valuable but recently Adam aeri posted this real he does say likes shares watch time they're all great but he says watch time is actually the most valuable signal watch time is basically how much of your video did somebody watch check to see of your nine videos which video received the best watch time keep that in in the back of your mind which video received the most shares keep that in the back of your mind you could even check to see which video got you the most follows because if it got you follows and you recreate that same type of content you'll probably get more follows so keep that in the back of your mind not only are you going to study which posts are working well and performed well but you also want to keep an eye on the posts that didn't perform well so that you don't go down that same path of trying to create that same type of content or you could learn and be like okay why didn't these perform well was it my hook was my hook laying lazy was I being lazy when I created that what do you need to do to improve on that concept studying your analytics is going to be key in unlocking the secrets to your specific growth because everybody's account is so different and the type of content that's going to work for you is going to look differently than your friend and me so I recommend studying your analytics a minimum at least once every 30 days if you're posting every day Monday through Friday maybe make it a routine at the end of the week check that whole week's performance and see which videos were performing well and didn't perform well you have to be willing to dive into your content from an unbiased perspective and very analytical to study and be curious and ask yourself okay what could I do what's working what are the numbers saying so just get comfortable with studying and being curious about your content day 16 keep learning and trying new things if you're a Creator who is wanting to grow as quickly as possible on Instagram I get it I have been there I remember being in the depths of like like okay how do I make this dang thing happen the one thing that I know worked for me was just continuing to educate myself and being open to trying new things trying new video Styles adapting to Instagram updates follow creators that teach Instagram strategies some of my favorite creators are Monty I love Monty's content he has an amazing membership where he helps you with creating reals that'll help you go viral Monty is such a great not only human but resource when it comes to Instagram he has both an Instagram and YouTube so check both of those out you could also follow Jade Jade is a dear friend of mine I love her so much and I love how practical

ChatGPT a dit :
Bien sûr — voici la traduction en français (ton dynamique, proche de l’original) :

Si je devais créer un compte Instagram à partir de zéro — zéro, nada, rien du tout — voici mon plan exact pour atteindre 10 000 abonnés le plus vite possible. Je parle d’un plan étape par étape : ce que je recommande de faire le jour 1, le jour 2, etc.

Non seulement j’ai fait grandir mon propre compte Instagram, mais j’ai aussi travaillé avec des centaines d’élèves pour les aider à grandir. Je fais l’audit des comptes Instagram de mes élèves chaque semaine, et voici les changements auxquels il faut s’engager si tu es sérieux(se) à propos de ta croissance.

Comme toujours, les time stamps et les ressources sont en dessous. Prends un stylo et du papier. C’est parti.

Jour 1 — Préparer ton compte pour un taux de conversion élevé en abonnés
C’est quoi un taux de conversion en abonnés, et comment configurer ton compte pour obtenir des abonnés dès le début ?

Ton taux de conversion en abonnés, c’est le pourcentage de personnes qui s’abonnent après avoir visité ton profil.
Donc si 100 personnes visitent ton profil, tu veux que le plus possible cliquent sur “S’abonner”. Si zéro personne ne s’abonne, ça indique que quelque chose cloche sur ton profil et doit être corrigé.

Pour mettre ton compte en place afin d’avoir un taux de conversion élevé, retiens simplement : PBC

P : Positionnement

B : Branding

C : Bio claire, Call-to-action, et Catégorie

P — Positionnement
Quel type de contenu vas-tu créer ? Et pour qui ?

Tu dois absolument savoir répondre à ces questions. Si tu ne peux pas y répondre clairement, l’algorithme d’Instagram aura énormément de mal à connecter ton contenu aux bonnes personnes.

Instagram l’a dit eux-mêmes dans un article Meta intitulé “Powered by AI: Instagram’s Explore recommender system” :
Ils expliquent qu’en construisant des “embeddings” de comptes, ils peuvent identifier plus efficacement quels comptes se ressemblent thématiquement.

L’algorithme commence donc par attribuer un sujet à ton profil. Si Instagram ne parvient pas à identifier un seul sujet clair, tu risques de poster pendant des années et d’avoir une croissance très lente… voire aucune.

Je vois ça constamment : des créateurs talentueux, incroyables, mais qui refusent de choisir un seul sujet. Ils postent “un peu de tout” (lifestyle), et restent bloqués au même niveau pendant des années.
Parce qu’ils refusent de choisir un thème.

Donc si tu veux scaler rapidement : tu dois choisir un sujet.

Une fois que l’algorithme comprend ton sujet, ils disent aussi que leurs techniques leur permettent de prédire avec quels comptes une personne est susceptible d’interagir pendant une session sur Instagram.
Autrement dit : ils peuvent commencer à recommander ton contenu à des gens qui s’intéressent à ton sujet.

C’est pour ça que tout le monde dit “niche down” sur Instagram : l’algorithme est littéralement conçu pour favoriser les comptes avec une niche claire.
Si tu ne veux pas te nicher, pas de souci : va plutôt sur TikTok. Mais si tu veux vraiment Instagram, tu dois te nicher.

Exemple : si je démarre un compte de zéro… faisons mon positionnement ensemble.

Quel type de contenu je crée ? → la course à pied

Pour qui ? → des débutants, des gens qui veulent commencer leur parcours de coureur, sans expérience

À toi : mets pause et écris tes réponses à ces deux questions. Si toi tu ne peux pas les formuler clairement, Instagram ne pourra pas non plus.

B — Branding
C’est la façon dont tu communiques ton positionnement sur l’app :
photo de profil, nom d’utilisateur, et surtout le nom affiché (la ligne en gras).

Photo de profil : représentation claire de toi, bonne lumière. Si tu peux l’aligner avec la niche, parfait. Par exemple, si je suis dans la course : une photo de moi en tenue de running, dehors, logique avec mon contenu.

Nom d’utilisateur : pas obligé d’être ultra “niche”, ça peut être ton nom. Mais il doit être simple, mémorisable et facile à épeler.

Nom affiché (en gras) : le plus important, car c’est la partie la plus recherchable sur Instagram.
Si quelqu’un tape “coach running” ou “conseils course”, les comptes qui ont ces mots dans la partie en gras ressortent.

Demande-toi :
Comment je veux que les gens me trouvent ?
Quels mots mon audience taperait dans la barre de recherche ?

Exemple :
Photo = moi en running
Username = “RunningWithMillie” (ou juste ton nom)
Nom en gras = “Millie — Running pour débutants”

C — Bio claire + Catégorie + Call-to-action
La bio, c’est là où beaucoup se plantent : ils parlent d’eux (“je viens de…”), ou mettent une phrase Pinterest (“suis ta joie”…).
Ta bio doit répondre à : Pourquoi te suivre ? Qu’est-ce que la personne gagne ?

Exemple de bio :
“J’aide les coureurs débutants à démarrer avec des conseils pratiques + motivation quotidienne.”

Simple, clair : si tu débutes et tu veux des conseils, tu t’abonnes.

Ensuite, la catégorie : choisis-en une qui correspond à ta niche. Instagram dit même que les catégories aident les gens à trouver des comptes comme le tien.

Enfin, le CTA (call-to-action) : je recommande à chaque créateur d’avoir un CTA qui mène les gens ailleurs.
Moi je conseille : même si tu débutes, crée un freebie, construis une liste email, un produit digital… quelque chose d’utile pour toi sur le long terme.

Ce qui m’amène au…

Jour 2 — Créer un “money magnet” (aimant à revenus)
C’est optionnel selon ton objectif. Mais si, comme moi, ton but est de monétiser, alors je le ferais.

L’idée : mettre en place un revenu passif dès maintenant, pour que ton revenu grandisse avec ton compte.

Tu prends une offre “low ticket” (petit prix) qui intéresse ton futur abonné.

Exemple dans la niche running débutant :

coaching 1:1 (si tu es qualifié)

guide / PDF de plan d’entraînement (ex : “0 à 5 km”)

challenge 30 jours

membership / club de course virtuel

guide “essentiels running” avec liens affiliés

Il y a toujours une façon de monétiser. Si tu te dis “je vois pas comment”, c’est souvent une croyance limitante.

Deux façons de trouver quoi vendre :

regarder d’autres créateurs de ta niche (leurs liens en bio)

demander à ChatGPT : “Je crée du contenu running pour débutants, propose-moi 25 idées de produits digitaux low ticket (10–47$).”

Une fois l’idée trouvée : mise en place simple via Stan Store (Stan).
Stan sert de “lien en bio” et te permet de vendre : produits digitaux, membership, coaching, cours… avec très peu de technique.

Process :

créer le produit sur Canva

exporter en PDF

l’ajouter dans Stan → “digital product”

titre, description, prix (ex : 27$), upload, publier

ajouter un CTA dans ta bio : “Télécharge ton plan 0→5 km ici”

Jour 3 — Précharger ta banque de contenu
Objectifs :

créer ta banque infinie d’idées

choisir tes 9 premières vidéos à publier

Pour la croissance : focus sur Reels au début.
Instagram a dit plusieurs fois que les Reels servent à atteindre de nouvelles personnes.

Méthode :

va dans la recherche Instagram

tape ton sujet (ici : running)

regarde les suggestions (running tips, motivation, outfits…)

clique, puis analyse uniquement les Reels

sauvegarde les Reels viraux dans des dossiers (ex : “running tips”)

Astuce : privilégie des Reels des 3 derniers mois pour voir ce qui marche actuellement.

Après 30 minutes :

retourne dans tes dossiers enregistrés

choisis 9 vidéos pour être tes 9 premières publications

Pas besoin d’être parfait : tu tests 9 formats différents :

face cam (talking head)

voice-over

audio tendance + b-roll

lip sync + texte relatable

éducatif / inspiration / divertissement / vlog “run with me”…

Le but : variété + test de ce qui marche pour toi.

Note tout ça dans un outil (Notes, Trello, ClickUp…).

Jour 4 — Batch filming (filmer en lot)
Filmer le plus possible.

Jour 5 — Batch editing (monter en lot)
Pendant le tournage/montage : applique le hook layering (super important).

Hook layering = superposer 3 hooks dans les 3 premières secondes :

hook texte (texte à l’écran)

hook audio (ce qu’on entend)

hook visuel (ce qu’on voit)

Si tu maîtrises ça : tu gagnes.

Jour 6 — Préparer tes drafts
Met tes 9 Reels en brouillons : texte, captions, tout prêt.

Première étape : sauvegarder un backup.
Instagram peut supprimer tes drafts, ça arrive.

Captions & mots-clés
Si ton objectif est la croissance : utilise un maximum de keywords.
Ex : si ton Reel est “running tips”, mets “running tips” :

dans la légende

dans le texte à l’écran

éventuellement dans les hashtags

Ça aide l’algorithme à comprendre ton contenu et peut aider à te classer dans la recherche Instagram (SEO).

Hashtags
Si je commençais de zéro : je ne ferais presque aucun effort.
Instagram a dit plusieurs fois que les hashtags ne sont pas un levier majeur de croissance.
Donc j’y passerais 10–20 secondes max.

Cover photo
Très important : qu’on comprenne immédiatement de quoi parle le Reel depuis la grille.
Ça augmente encore plus ton taux de conversion.

Jour 7 — Définir ton rythme de publication
Objectif : poster autant que possible sans burnout.

Plus tu postes, plus tu as de chances de grandir vite… mais la longévité est plus importante.
Il n’y a pas de nombre magique : trouve un rythme tenable pendant 2 ans.

Exemple : 3 fois/semaine (lundi/mercredi/vendredi).
Tes 9 Reels = 3 semaines de contenu.

Poster “en live” (pas en auto-post) peut donner de meilleurs résultats (selon mes tests).

Jours 8 à 14 — Maîtriser ta routine (la “roue du hamster”)
Maintenir ton rythme.

Si filmer 9 vidéos d’un coup marche pour toi : fais-le toutes les 2 semaines.
Si tu n’en fais que 3 : parfait, adapte (1 à 2 sessions par semaine).
Teste jusqu’à trouver ton système.

Jour 15 — Analyser les données et améliorer la stratégie
Quand tu as assez de data, analyse les 9 premières.

Regarde 3 signaux :

likes

partages

watch time (le plus important)

Watch time = combien de ta vidéo les gens regardent.
Garde en tête :

celle avec le meilleur watch time

celle qui a eu le plus de partages

celle qui a généré le plus d’abonnements

Observe aussi ce qui n’a pas marché : hook faible ? valeur pas claire ? exécution “lazy” ?
Les analytics te donnent les clés de ta croissance.

Analyse au minimum 1 fois tous les 30 jours.
Si tu postes souvent, fais-le chaque semaine.

Jour 16 — Continuer à apprendre et tester
Si tu veux grandir vite : continue à te former, à tester des styles, à t’adapter aux updates.

Quelques créateurs à suivre (Instagram/YouTube) :

Monty

Jade

Dominic (très analytique, no fluff)

Et ensuite… tu regardes la prochaine vidéo 😄 Merci d’avoir regardé, à la prochaine. Toute ma joie, bye !

Si tu veux, je peux aussi te faire une version plus courte (type script voix-off / carousel) ou une traduction plus “France” vs “Québec”, selon ton style.

Vous avez dit :
Tu peux traduire ça aussi. Ou donnes les idées applicables puisque ici c’est un dialogue et pas une personne qui parle seul « I don't ask if it'll go viral I can figure out how to make it viral that is an absurd thing to say that's Jenny Hoyos an 18-year-old YouTuber who is absolutely crushing shorts she's done over 600 million views in the past year alone averaging 10 million views per video how does she do it I have analyzed thousands of shorts I've analyzed all of Mr B shorts all of Ryan Tran's shorts and what I found was in this episode you'll learn how to make anything go viral I think you can make a video about anything it's just adding and how to create the perfect short every second counts on a short like every single second whatever you say you're going to do you end it right after you do it the difference is in short form content platforms short form content is not the same across platforms I noticed that YouTube likes and a hot take you might not be expecting retention doesn't matter as much as people think it does you said this kind of aside you said well I can make anything go viral like if the idea is good I can make I can make it go viral which is an absurd thing to say and I want to hear what that means to you how do you how do you make anything go viral it's just adding story and a Twist especially with shorts since like no one's actually having to click on your video I think you can make a video about anything you can make video about paint drawing and you can make make it entertaining if there's a story around it and if the viewer is invested what are your favorite ways to get people invested how do you how do you make a story that people care about I think my content is very personality based I'd say so for me making it personal makes them invested I'll give you an example I actually did this in a long form in the video I cooked for strangers to make money okay very Baseline why should they care well my kitchen is broken and I want to raise money for it by cooking and making money you know it's it's ironic like I'm my kitchen's broken so in order to fix it I have to cook to make money so I think that's what makes people invested having like some sort of personal why or goal and irony too is pretty funny I like that I like that irony jux to position Jenny's the hero of the story exactly what makes a good short when I think of good it's very subjective so there's no direct definition as to what makes a good short because everyone has different taste but I can say what makes a good short to me okay let's hear that to me a good short is one that has a strong hook as the way I like to explain it is if it could be used as a title in thumbnail on a long form and like it will still get clicks then it'll work for a short you know so the hook needs to be very visual you need to understand it without even listening to it and it needs to be so simple like so simply said like you said explain to a 5-year-old so I think that's one of the key things and then also just a story that just you know pushes you through and not only do you watch to the end but you rewatch it again so that's what makes a good short to me let's say that you are planning or want to create a new video how do you start thinking about hooks or how do you generate hooks it's it's very funny because I like to I like to see shorts like as like even though I don't do that many long forms I like to see shorts as if I'm making like a long form so like I will sketch like almost as if it's tied on thumbnails so like I have my iPad and I draw like what would I visually want it to look like what are different ways if I was to put it together what would that look like so when I'm making a hook I just like keep drawing and sketching or like even just imagining until something just clicks so the first thing is the visual easily the first thing is the visual and then I figure out how I'm going to accompany that Visual and what I'm saying I try to make it as concise as possible and I'll put it in a readability Checker and then make sure that it's actually like understandable to at least like fifth grade or under H what's what's the readability Checker that you use uh I don't I don't know I don't pay for it it's readability formulas. comom is the one I use and you want to be fifth grade or under fifth grade or under yeah have you have you played around with things that are uh older quote unquote than that and seeing that that's the level that it should be at or how did you arrive at fifth grade yeah so I have analyzed thousands of shorts as you may know so I've like scraped you know the scripts of a bunch of shorts and and I've put it in this readability Checker and I've noticed that the most popular shorts especially Mr Beast you know Mr Beast is one of the best shorts creators and his is like in first grade level so I just basically like after scraping everything that's when I realized like fifth grade and under is like about the range you want to be at yeah I think yeah that's a simply foot yeah how did you land on fifth grade was that the average of all of these I'm not going to lie the readability can sometimes be off but it was um it was just like at a range cuz I I believe like like a for example is like slightly higher I don't know the exact number in the top of my head but I I just noticed that like a good in between as fifth grade but I will say the problem with the readability is especially like with content like mine you can change the readability from fifth grade to like e8th grade by simply using the word business which is why I try to avoid things like that or if you use the word Finance or if you use like for example profit instead of saying profit I just explain the definition of profit every time I talk about it I did know this about you I did not know that you analyze thousands of shorts by scraping the titles and the transcripts can you tell me more about that yeah so it's so funny because like basically the way I do it is you know when you go on to YouTube and you open up a short it sends you like even on desktop it sends you to like this shorts page or whatever but if you change the url to like watch question mark V equals then the URL then it will send you to like the actual YouTube page and then you can just click transcript copy and paste that transcript and then I just check the readability but I also like check other things you know I just analyze why these shorts are working so interesting so interesting I I would love to hear anything else that comes to mind as you were looking at all this that started to help you pull together your own short strategy because I did not realize that you had done all this research and pulled all this together this gets me very very excited as the Creator Science Guy I am super excited about this this research yes so I've also like deeply analyzed all of my videos and I think that's where you learn the most everyone has different audiences so what works for Mr Beast might not work for me right so what I did is like I did my own little experiment like when I knew I wanted to get into shorts I told myself I was going to upload every day for as long as possible and I think I only got like a week or two in it didn't it I didn't I didn't get that far but the goal was essentially to upload as much as possible quantity is what makes quality when I was doing that quantity I would analyze my retention graph and this is just like one example I'll just pull out for you so there was one video after 5 days I got I think it was like 50,000 views in 5 days right which I on average I usually get like a million so I was not happy with the performance and I pulled up the retention graph and I noticed on the last second it was a huge dip it was 70% 1 second later it was 45% like a 25 % drop in 1 second and the retention was 83% so what I did was I went to YouTube Studio I trimmed off that 1 second YouTube removed this feature by the way YouTube please bring it back but just by removing that one second at the end it went from 83% to 88% and the video went flying and that that's why like every second counts on a short like every single second because when you think about it let's say you have a 30 second short right if you lose 1 second that's already 90 7% That's three percentages you know if you have lose two seconds that's 6% so when you think about it I'm sure it's like you're not just losing one second you're losing double or even triple because that one second accumulates to two or 3% of the video the takeaway here I believe is that you really want in a short high retention of course we want High retention and everything but I've heard some people talk about you really want people to sometimes Loop and watch even into a repeat of the thing is that true yes yes and I'll explain why the average scroll through rate which is basically like on YouTube shorts you can see what percentage who like what percentage of people viewed versus swiped away and I like to call it scroll through rate but the average scroll through rate is like 70% you want to get that as high as possible my personal scroll through rate is like 85% so my average scroll through rate is 85% but my average retention is 95 5% if only 85% of people are watching it how does the retention subtly get to 95% it's because they're rewatching it so to have that like 90 plus per retention which is like in my opinion the bare minimum like for a short uh blow up you need them to watch it again so 90% is your benchmark that's what you're looking for for retention for something that will have the the virality and reach that you're accustomed to at this point for the most part yes I will say it depends on the amount of Impressions because my videos average like 95% retention but we're talking like that's on 10 million views so that's like it's very difficult to do right so yeah okay so you mentioned that with the hooks you think about the visual nature of it are you talking about the first frame of the actual video yes I'm talking about the first frame I don't know how many shorts you've seen so I'll try and to explain it I I've seen more than one but less than you so let's let's assume on the yeah so I have this series where I remake fast food items for a dollar instead of like showing my face I show the location I show the front of the location because obviously like more people know the fast food location than they know me the easiest way to describe like the video just visually is by showing the fast food item in front of the location so usually it's so funny I would have the logo in the middle and then I'll put the food item here and and then right in the middle I'll put like $1 burrito $1 sandwich $1 Burger so then it's like you perfectly see it it's always perfectly aligned and it really helps for bability too because it's actually a playlist and I get a lot of views from people like just like watching it down and they they just know it's me every time they see that framing so interesting was this all trial and error or did you model this this style of of Framing and hook off of anyone in particular it's Ely like pry and error at first I started by I guess you can say stealing like stealing like an artist cuz that's how to me I I believe that's how you learn sure you obviously want to find your own style but I started by like copying other people's Hooks and then I was looking at like Which percentage is the highest so I it sounds so funny so like a a strategy a technique is like what would it sound like if this YouTuber made this video and then I would make a bunch of hooks depending on that so I'll have like a list of like the big 10 and then I'll just like you know have a bunch of different hooks pick which one's my favorite see the percentage and then assess what's the best hook then I made my own twist into it after a quick break Jenny walks me through her process for coming up with great ideas so stick around we'll be right back if you know me you know how much I believe in memberships my membership is the core of my business and I believe that earning a living directly from your audience is one of the most sustainable ways for for you to become a professional Creator as well so I want to tell you about today's sponsor uscreen uscreen

generating a sustainable income stream for professional creators to try you screen click the link in the description and let them know that Jay sent you what would you say is your proportion of like video ideas to videos you actually create oh gosh well I have like right now in a Google doc I have a list of a thousand ideas crazy and I'm only doing 10 crazy so so these are Depends these are a thousand ideas not a thousand hooks a thousand different video ideas that could each have multiple different hooks within them yes it's it's it's crazy yeah where do they come from how do you generate that many ideas okay there's a lot of ways so one way is I just watch YouTube and then see what I personally you know like want to recreate and like twist or it's like what video do I want to watch or um as funny as it sounds I also use ai ai has some pretty good ideas but the best ideas at least for me personally they come from just living it and then thinking this is a video idea so let me explain that so one of my most popular videos is me making a garden as funny as it sounds cuz that sounds like it would get no views yet it has like I think it has like 30 million views like so that's a ton there's so many ideas where something like this happened one day I was eating Ratatouille because it's like one of my favorite foods right and I'm like I can't believe like it costs $20 to cook and I'm like but can't I just make a garden and then have unlimited Ratatouille for like five bucks and I'm like oh my gosh that's a video idea so I'm like now I got to make a garden and then I'm going to grow vegetables to have infinite Ratatouille because it's my favorite food so like that's where the story came from or like another time my grandma it was so funny she got like like I think it was like laundry detergent in the mail or whatever like free laundry detergent and I'm like how'd you get free laundry detergent that's like 30 bucks and she was like oh I called the company and I complained to them I told them that they suck and they sent me free laundry detergent and I'm like that's a video I got to do that so it's like you know just things that I live and then I'm like that needs to be a video those are my best ideas so how do you go from a th000 ideas to narrow it down to 10 what is the deciding factor of which videos make the cut yeah so I would say I narrow it I narrow it down to like like let's say we have 100 because 100's like an easier number to work with so let's say we have 100 ideas I'll narrow it down to like 25 25 to 50 that's usually just based on like the first thing I ask myself is do I want to make it I don't ask if it'll go viral I can figure out how to make it viral if I really want to make it so first I tell myself do I actually want to make this is this actually logistically possible and then it's like is the hook good is the mechanism good are people going to rewatch this then that's when I look at like where's the virality aspect in this then I'll bring it down to 25 then from there I'll send it to um my video editor who's also like he's just like he's really involved in the channel so he's not just a video editor he's also like a strategist because you know he's he he knows a lot about YouTube and um I'll send it to him and he'll bring my 25 to like 10 and he'll basically he'll go in and tell me like even further if it actually seems viral if he thinks it's sharable but for him like he's really good at telling if if a concept is simple yet complex if that makes sense M mhm you mentioned a word a second ago you said is the mechanism good what do you you mean by mechanism if they're going to be pushed to the end so like a good example is Mr Beast the red circle like is it like last leave Circle wins $500,000 the mechanism is the circle is constantly closing so the viewer is watching till the end so if if it was just like the circle wasn't closing I don't know if anyone watch to the end they'll just skip to the end probably interesting what are some of the mechanisms that you've used I think this is the easiest one that anyone can apply it's basically saying there's three steps or there's three things we need to do because it's very easy to follow and you just showed the list of three so now the viewer knows that oh we're getting closer to the video like they actually have a good expectation which is probably one of the biggest things I think that's I think that's why my videos like go viral it's because people have a good expectation of what they're going to watch and what's actually going to be at the end so when it comes to expectations if you set expectations do you find that then the the next step is completely following through on those expectations or do you ever try to like subvert expectations for an element of surprise or something I try to follow those expectations but then have a twist for example I gave my mom a $5 Mother's Day gift the hook was my mom's Never Had A Mother's Day gift so I'm going to change that and buy her the best present with $5 it was it was the why making them car in the hook my mom's Never Had A Mother's Day gift so I'm going to change that then the expectation is so I'm going to surprise her with a gift for $5 and on screen I'm showing me giving her the gift but you're going to see that till the end so it's like it's the the cold open and then we cut to the video so the expectation is by the end of the video you're going to see me give her a gift so then I follow through make the gift and then I surprise her now I gave them the expectation I closed the loop that I'm going to surprise her with this gift but the twist was she ended up dropping the gift it broke and then she's like you're the best daughter I've ever had I'm like I'm your only one video ends so it's like yeah I I gave that expectation that I'm going to gift her and then we just Twisted it at the end how long would you say on average your shorts are oh I know exactly the answer because I've done the analysis okay what's the answer it's it's exactly 34 seconds because my most popular videos are exactly that length so I try to make it exactly that length that was going to be my next question was to say do is that now your your benchmark for what you're looking for in a video 34 seconds yes so yes everyone's is different everyone got to analyze it like for their their own channel and I think I've seen well I was in uh I was in Pat Galler's accelerator and he showed some research that he had done to show like depending on your short length this is the bar for retention you should be shooting for so I'm guessing that 90% retention is also related to the average total length of your videos whereas if it shorter maybe you need retention to be higher to achieve the same virality exactly yes correct so for me for my personal Channel like I said like there's no specific number I think everyone just has to check out their analytics but for me I noticed if a short is less than 30 seconds it needs to it has to have over 100% retention or else it's not going to take off so that's why I like to make it slightly longer but too long is too long for my audience since I do have a very young audience if you know that you want your videos to be about 34 seconds I'm thinking if it's 34 seconds and you know that you want your last second retention to be really high it seems like the payoff is like literally the last second so now we got 34 33 seconds to work with you probably know how long your hook generally is so maybe that's you know 3 seconds or 5 seconds and you have this remainder of 28 to 30 seconds in the middle do you break that down into specific pieces of the mechanism or is that just kind of whatever happens in the edit yeah so it's usually whatever happens in the edit but what I do check is before I film the video I will do a rough script even if it's not even what happens in the video like I'll just roughly you know do it and I can just change it later and from there I'll have a sense of how long it is just from the word count but I don't necessarily force it I just let it free flow like you said in the edit but I do have a rough idea of the word count and my Hooks and foreshadow I always do that in every video I do a hook and then I foreshadow which is two lines and that is usually 3 seconds or less and foreshadow you're saying that's in that's in the voiceover because I know you mentioned like that the example of your your mom's gift when you see her grab the package that's foreshadowing in a way but that's completely visual you're saying you dedicate some spoken time to foreshadowing as well yes I always have spoken time to foreshadowing it like it doesn't matter what video idea it is like like like let me just pull up like a random idea like I'm going to the beach right and then it's like why would someone watch so that's the hook I'm going to the Beach and what's the foreshadow I'm going to the beach and I'm going to surprise someone with $100 at the end of the video it could literally be with anything it just needs to have some sort of expectation I want to keep going down this the structure Rabbit Hole a little bit more because I keep finding new layers like I didn't know foreshadowing is part of your structure so is there anything that comes after the hook and foreshadowing that is a structural part of every video yes there actually is so it will usually be hook which is really short then I'll foreshadow what's going to be at the end then I have to smoothly transition so I used to have like a lot of breaks cuz you want to give people time to breathe right because you don't want to be like I'm going to be doing this and this and this and this the video's over I didn't like they they're not going to understand anything so you want a pacing break without the pacing actually breaking let me explain what I mean by that this I did this in my recent video so it was like McDonald's banned this item hook so I'm gonna make it at home then convince them to put it back on the menu That's the foreshadow and then at first I wrote let's get started but that breaks pace so instead of saying let's get started I said so I cooked illegally that that just flows better so I I don't want to give like cuz I already gave like two crucial pieces of detail so if I give any more detail they're just going to forget about that like pracy recency if you I can get into that so it's like they're going to forget what I just said so we need a pacing break without the pacing actually breaking if that makes sense yeah totally okay let's keep going down this this Trail is there is there more structural pieces past the transition usually it's just like problem solution or but therefore storytelling okay tell me more about but therefore storytelling basically but there but therefore storytelling simply put is just lots of change in the story so a story stories can't be stories without change for example I went a walk then it started raining then I went back home it was much more boring than if it was like I went on a walk but it started raining therefore I started running back home and I I it was raining all over me but good thing I had a handy umbrella while I was on my way back therefore I got home like it's the exact same story but it just sounds so much more intriguing when you have like but and then so or but therefore I'm so glad that you're able to like whip up these examples on the Fly this is must be very stressful the the spots I'm putting you on but you're just like I got it yeah so if I'm thinking from an order of operation standpoint I'm I'm making some assumptions I'm realizing and I want to make sure I'm correct in them it sounds like you have ideas first then you narrow that down to a small number of ideas and ultimately a video that you say yes this idea my editor and I have decided is a good one uh you come up with versions of the hook and then it seems like you you start recording and after recording you start editing and then after editing comes the transcript for the voiceover did I get that right you were close you were close like you said ideas then I find that one idea then I'll write my hook then I'll write the last line so I always know the last line when I'm going to film then I'll go back and then after the hook I figure out how I'm going to foreshadow that I I will always have the hook for so I always have two lines so it'll be like hook foreshadow end um but in between it would be like it depends on the video sometimes it will be a rough script like we were saying so I can have that structure in mind or it will just be bullet points of things I want to touch on while I'm filming then I will film once I filmed I will revisit the script again revise it finalize it then it goes and edit how do you write the last line without knowing what comes out in the filming it's you'd like leave it in blank so it would be like for example if I'm surprising someone with a gift the last line would be then like it's so simple then I surprised my mom and and then blank so it's usually reaction just to have a general idea yes yeah exactly yes okay I was watching your videos this morning and I I was like really I I took note of the fact that they all end very abruptly but like not in a way where I'm like what happened it's it's like it's pleasing but it is abrupt and we already talked about how you you kind of learned this and you trimed it off but it is like and I surprised my mom and you know and then and then her reaction and then end you mentioned a moment ago that the age of your audience is typically a little bit younger how much do you think about who the audience is when you think of ideas you know because in my world to step back a second in my world a lot of times folks have like a very specific Avatar that they're creating for who's trying to achieve some sort of specific goal I don't think that's the same in more of the entertainment space so i' love to hear to what level of detail you think about an audience member in your mind yeah that's everything Avatar is everything so for me I will think of like specific people so I will think of like me when I was younger I'll think about like the these are my favorites to think about by the way my my my nieces are 10 years old 10 I have two nieces that are seven and 10 and they just moved to America last year so they barely understand English and that's that's who I want to speak to it's it's very tough because they might not be interested in the topic but if I can make them interested and especially if it makes sense to them as non-english speakers then it's probably really good so that's the way I see it it's not necessarily thinking of like their their dream their desires but more so how can you speak to them I just it just I don't know if that makes sense because it's like it's it's different it it makes sense it's interesting for me to hear because I just don't speak to folks on the more entertainment side of the Creator world as often so actually I'm just coming at it from Natural Curiosity to hear how you do think about it I would imagine at the level of views you're getting tens of Millions on these on these videos it's a broad spectrum of people who are looking at this so who you who do you choose as the core of yes people outside of this type of person maybe it's my nieces will watch this but I'm making it for this person in particular I didn't know if you had that specificity or not like I said I do and I don't so it's in the sense of like I it's mainly like my younger self which is like kind of weird because I can't actually my younger yourself can't actually watch it but that's like the way I think of it if that makes sense yeah for sure for sure can we talk a little bit about Instagram reals and Tik Tok and how you think about those because a lot of times people think short form vertical video it's same everywhere choose wherever you're leading and then just post it to all three and it's clear that your your YouTube is is much bigger than the other two platforms and those other platforms are much bigger than mine so that's not any judgment on you but I'm curious what you're hearing or what you're experiencing in terms of how this does or does not translate hey real quick before they respond I want to let you know that there are bonus Audio Only episodes of Creator science that air every Tuesday when we don't publish a video episodes like number 156 where I talk with my editor Connor about our first year on YouTube or number 37 with Oli abdal if that's interesting just search for Creator science wherever you listen to podcasts all right back to the show yeah so sh from content is not the same across platforms and I know this because I used to do very well on Tik Tok before I was doing well on YouTube In fact when I had like a thousand subscribers on YouTube I had like 70k on Tik Tok so I was doing much better and I was averaging like a million views per Tik Tok What was crazy is I remember at this at this point I was posting to all three platforms but Tik Tok was getting all the views YouTube shorts and Instagram reals were getting like none of it were you thinking about one of those platforms as like your lead platform at that time it was definitely Tik Tok so you're thinking I'm making this video for Tik Tok I'm also posting to reals and I'm also pointing posting shorts correct but it wasn't edited on the Tik Tok app like it would still be filmed you know like professionally and then edited it and then posting on Tik Tok the same video that would get 1 million views on Tik Tok would get 1,000 views on YouTube shorts and I was like okay let me switch a strategy CU I bought baned on Tik talk like for a short period of time I'm like let me focus on YouTube and then the opposite happened I started averaging 1 million views on YouTube and then a th000 on Tik Tok I'm like this is really strange like these platforms definitely won different content and what I found YouTube likes definitely a slower more mature you know it's a more mature audience so they want like a slower Pace more story so those would be like the 34 second tick uh 34 second shorts that I'm making right now Tik Tok on the other hand did not like did not like videos over 30 seconds it liked 10 to 20 second videos that were just like dense with information not that many jokes just like you know just just scrollable they're just trying to scroll as much as possible versus Instagram reals was also slightly more mature but because they have that mute feature a lot of those videos would be very Visual and would have like subtitles in every second and would have like a lot of sharability since it's very it's it's very easy to share on Instagram how do you think about long form now is it something that you aspire to do more of how does it play into the Jenny hoyo Universe yes the Jenny ho Universe sounds like the MCU but yeah I I really want to get into long form I want to become established there basically what I did to shorts is exactly what I'm doing to long form I have been studying long forms for the past year learning as much as I can analyzing everything and now it's just time to execute so the goal is to pull off what I did on shorts on long form and then just you know upload a uh upload a a good amount between them I'm never going to quit shorts it's just going to be a good balance between the two what is long form represent to you that it's a priority you know you're so good at shorts you're you're like at the top of the mountain there why is long form something that's calling to you you know I think I mean it's a lot of reasons I feel it's kind of tough saying it but I think that they simply put I don't see that much more growth for me in shorts like sure I can start averaging like a 100 million views but it's like the real growth and fun is going to come from learning long form CU it's all about the journey you know it's like um it sounds so bad to say but I feel like I've already achieved my goal for like for shorts you know and it's like I I want to you know challenge myself again I just don't feel like I'm challenging myself with shorts this is a guess in short yeah no it's valid I your your reasons are your reasons they're totally valid I was I was I was wondering if it had anything to do with like is a relationship to the audience different in long form I'm sure there's more money in long form and I was wondering if those were part of the decision or if it was just a you know time to climb a new Mountain type situation I will say as ironic as it sounds money is not the reason why like when I first like started my entrepreneurship journey I was like money is everything right but then when I I started YouTube I realized like it doesn't matter how much I'm making like I'm just doing this so money like it's crazy as funny as it sounds because my content is all about money I don't even care Oh much I'm thinking it's funny as it sounds it's weird how it works but yeah is yeah the yeah it's just I think I think there is a better relationship with the viewer I feel like it's just it's just more it's more it's more personal you know like you guys are spending more time together for sure I think it is like a time spent situation like I feel like we really build trust as a function of time spent and the more spent time you spend with somebody like the more of a relationship you build relationships are built on trust curious if you think that your shorts audience will transition into long form or if you're thinking about you know the audience themselves the same like are these long form videos also going to be for your 10-year-old nieces it's it's a different audience you know it's really funny I want to tell this story because I thought it was absolutely hilarious and it's just going to open up like because to me it was it was huge I had a little cousin uh visit my house it was the first time I ever met her because she was also from another country and she she's like seven years old she came to my house first thing she said I'm cousins with a famous YouTuber it was so funny then the second thing she said she was like telling me how like she loves my shorts and she was like you know what you should check out I was like I was on YouTube and I noticed like they have these like horizontal videos that are like shorts but just like long and I was like that's crazy that's crazy that type of thing breaks my mind it's like it's like the videos where it's like we ask listen to and it's like insert bandn from my childhood here and like this is bad exactly it was one of those moments where it realized it opened it it was like that those are really two different audiences cuz there's some people who probably don't even know long forms are a thing and vice versa some people that don't even know shorts or thing then there's the people that know both so I know I'm going to get you know I'm not going to get all of my audience I have had some audience transition but yeah that's where I'm at and you think that's a is that a YouTube thing or is that an audience preference thing I think it's an audience preference thing for sure yeah I think YouTube's doing like as funny as it sounds because I feel like a lot of shorts creators like oh I feel so bad saying this CU I'm not one of them but I'm calling them out like there's shorts creators who have like a million subscribers and then they don't even get like a thousand views on a long form and then they're like it's YouTube's fault yeah but like in reality it's like their fault you know like um I average like 10 million views on shorts and then long forms I'm averaging like 50k views you know so it's like I think they're doing a pretty good job at like transitioning them just obviously not everyone's going to transition all right last question which I love to ask people is there anything that you believe to be true and we can relate it to YouTube or shorts but you don't yet have data to support oh there's there's a couple I'm trying to think what I should I think I got a good one I'm going to say two okay because I'm there's two that are really good bonus I think sharability really matters but I haven't done enough like analysis on that yet but I'm sure I can do my own analysis it's it's very tough because there's a lot of factors to that that come into play because you know I could argue this video has a lot of shares that's why I blew up but then I could also just argue that the retention was high so do you really know I I don't know so that that's my Hench I think sharability really does help although I will say like one of my shorts it has like such high shares it has like what was it like the shares to view ratio it's 20% Which is extremely high that seems very high and the scroll through rate is like 92% which is insane and it's probably because the shares are are that high and then my second hunch is that retention doesn't matter as much as people think it does say more it's very interesting because I have a lot of friends like who will send me their retention graphs or like their data their analytics and there's people like within like a similar amount of impressions as me like their retention will be so much higher than mine like there's friends like they would have like a 40 second short that has like 100k views and over 100% retention and I'm like oh my gosh this video is going to get like 10 million views and like it's it's not even Niche either but then it never it never does that but then for me like yeah like for me what's crazy is like you know I I've had a short before where I had like 70% retention on the first 100K views which is like really bad like really really bad for shorts and it still got like 10 million views because it was like all returning viewers you know so it's like I just have a hunch that like you know like I don't know I don't know what it is what what how they're measuring it it's just viewer satisfaction it can't it can't just be retention you know »
ChatGPT a dit :
Oui — je peux te donner une version “adaptée dialogue” (plus naturelle en français) et en dessous les idées applicables (ce qu’on peut retenir / appliquer).

Traduction adaptée (format dialogue, naturel)
— « Je ne me demande pas si ça va devenir viral. Je peux trouver comment le rendre viral. »
— « C’est une phrase complètement folle. »
C’est Jenny Hoyos, une YouTubeuse de 18 ans qui cartonne sur les Shorts : plus de 600 millions de vues sur l’année, environ 10 millions de vues par vidéo. Comment elle fait ?

J’ai analysé des milliers de Shorts (ceux de MrBeast, de Ryan Trahan, etc.) et dans cet épisode, tu vas apprendre comment rendre presque n’importe quoi viral — et comment construire le Short parfait.

— « Sur un Short, chaque seconde compte. Vraiment chaque seconde. Tout ce que tu promets, tu le montres — et tu termines juste après. »
— « Mais le short-form n’est pas le même selon les plateformes. »
— « Et hot take : la rétention ne compte pas autant que les gens le pensent. »

— « Tu disais : “Je peux rendre n’importe quoi viral si l’idée est bonne.” Qu’est-ce que tu veux dire par là ? Comment tu rends “n’importe quoi” viral ? »
— « Tu ajoutes une histoire… et un twist. Sur les Shorts, les gens n’ont même pas besoin de cliquer : ça démarre tout seul. Tu peux faire une vidéo sur n’importe quoi — même de la peinture — si tu construis une histoire autour et si le spectateur est investi. »

— « Comment tu fais pour que les gens s’investissent ? »
— « Mon contenu est très basé sur ma personnalité. Donc rendre ça personnel les implique. Exemple : “Je cuisine pour des inconnus pour gagner de l’argent.” Pris comme ça, on s’en fiche. Mais si je dis : “Ma cuisine est cassée et je veux financer la réparation en cuisinant”, là il y a un pourquoi… et c’est même ironique : pour réparer ma cuisine, je dois cuisiner. L’ironie aide beaucoup. »
— « Donc Jenny est l’héroïne de l’histoire. »
— « Exactement. »

— « C’est quoi un bon Short ? »
— « C’est subjectif, mais pour moi : un bon Short a un hook très fort. Si le hook pouvait servir de titre + miniatures pour une vidéo longue et donner envie de cliquer, alors il marche en Short. Il doit être ultra visuel, compréhensible sans le son, super simple — “niveau enfant de 5 ans”. Et ensuite une histoire qui te pousse jusqu’à la fin… et qui te donne envie de le re-regarder. »

— « Comment tu trouves tes hooks ? »
— « Je pense “visuel d’abord”. Je sketch sur iPad comme si je dessinais une miniature. Je dessine jusqu’à ce qu’une idée clique. Ensuite je cherche quoi dire pour accompagner l’image, le plus concis possible. Et je teste le texte avec un outil de lisibilité : je vise niveau 5e année ou moins (en gros, très simple). »
— « Pourquoi ce niveau ? »
— « J’ai analysé des milliers de scripts : les Shorts les plus performants (MrBeast) sont parfois niveau 1re année. Donc je vise 5e ou moins. Et j’évite des mots qui font grimper la “difficulté” (ex : “business”, “finance”). Si je dois parler de “profit”, je le définis au lieu d’utiliser le mot. »

— « Tu analyses comment ? »
— « Je récupère les transcriptions des Shorts et je check la lisibilité, mais aussi pourquoi ça marche. Et surtout : j’analyse MES vidéos à moi, parce que chaque audience est différente. »

Jenny raconte un test : une vidéo faisait 50k vues en 5 jours, elle regarde la courbe de rétention : énorme chute sur la dernière seconde. Elle coupe 1 seconde à la fin : la rétention passe de 83% à 88% et la vidéo décolle.
— « Chaque seconde compte. Sur 30 secondes, perdre 1 seconde c’est déjà ~3% de la vidéo. »

— « Et pour exploser, il faut que les gens re-regardent ? »
— « Oui. Sur YouTube Shorts, j’ai ~85% de “scroll-through rate” (les gens qui ne swipent pas). Pourtant ma rétention moyenne est ~95%. Comment c’est possible ? Parce qu’ils re-regardent. Pour moi, viser 90%+ de rétention, c’est le minimum pour qu’un Short “prenne”. »

Elle explique aussi le premier frame : hyper important. Exemple : sa série “refaire du fast food pour 1$”. Elle montre d’abord le logo du fast food + l’objet + “1$” bien cadré. Les gens reconnaissent instantanément la série.

— « Tu as copié des hooks au début ? »
— « Oui, comme un artiste : tu copies puis tu trouves ton style. Je teste beaucoup de versions de hook, je garde celui qui a le meilleur taux d’accroche, puis j’ajoute mon twist. »

Ensuite elle parle des idées :
— « J’ai une liste de 1000 idées, j’en fais peut-être 10. »
Les idées viennent de :

regarder YouTube et tordre un concept

l’IA (parfois utile)

surtout : la vraie vie (ex : “et si je faisais un jardin pour avoir du ratatouille illimité ?” / “ma grand-mère a eu de la lessive gratuite en se plaignant — je dois tester ça”)

Comment elle choisit quoi produire :

Est-ce que j’ai envie de le faire ? (pas “est-ce viral”)

Est-ce logistique ?

Hook bon ? mécanisme bon ? rewatch probable ?
Puis son éditeur l’aide à passer de 25 idées à 10.

— « C’est quoi un “mécanisme” ? »
— « C’est ce qui pousse à rester jusqu’à la fin. Exemple MrBeast : “le dernier dans le cercle gagne”, et le cercle se referme. »
Mécanisme facile à appliquer : “3 étapes / 3 choses” : on sait qu’on avance vers la fin.

Structure type Jenny :

hook (très court)

foreshadowing (annoncer ce qu’on verra à la fin)

transition sans casser le rythme (pas “allez on commence”)

storytelling “BUT / THEREFORE” (des changements constants)

fin très abrupte juste après le payoff

Elle vise une durée précise :
— « Mes vidéos les plus populaires font 34 secondes, donc je vise 34 secondes. »
Et elle remarque : <30 secondes → parfois besoin de 100%+ de rétention pour décoller.

Sur les plateformes :

YouTube Shorts : rythme un peu plus “mature”, plus story, ~34s marche bien

TikTok : préfère plus court (10–20s), plus dense, très “scrollable”

Instagram Reels : plus visuel, beaucoup de sous-titres, très partageable (car facile à envoyer)

Elle veut faire plus de long format :
— « Parce que j’ai l’impression d’avoir “fini” le jeu des Shorts. Long form = nouveau défi + relation plus profonde. »

Et ses “hunches” (intuitions) :

la partageabilité compte énormément (mais difficile à isoler)

la rétention ne suffit pas à expliquer la viralité : il y a aussi la satisfaction, les viewers récurrents, etc.

Les idées applicables (ce que tu peux appliquer direct)
1) “Rendre n’importe quoi viral” = histoire + twist
Même un sujet banal marche si tu ajoutes :

un pourquoi personnel (objectif / problème)

une ironie / contradiction (ex : réparer une cuisine en cuisinant)

un twist final (surprise, retournement, gag)

2) Le hook doit être visuel et compréhensible sans le son
Pense au premier frame comme une miniature.

Si tu peux “lire” la vidéo en 1 seconde, c’est bon.

3) Écriture ultra simple
Niveau “enfant” = phrases courtes, mots simples.

Évite les mots abstraits (business/finance…) → remplace par une explication.

4) Structure Jenny (super réutilisable)
Hook (0–1,5 s)

Foreshadow (annoncer la fin : “à la fin je vais…”) (≤ 3 s total)

Mécanisme clair (3 étapes / compte à rebours / défi / règle)

But/Therefore (rebondissements, obstacles, changements)

Payoff (la promesse tenue)

Cut immédiat (fin abrupte, pas de blabla)

5) “Chaque seconde compte”
Coupe les fins molles.

Si tu promets X, termine juste après X.

6) La rétention ≠ tout
Ce qui compte aussi :

rewatch (les gens re-regardent)

scroll-through rate (les gens ne swipent pas)

satisfaction / partages / viewers récurrents

7) Systématise le “mécanisme”
Mécaniques simples que tout le monde peut utiliser :

“3 choses / 3 étapes”

“si je réussis X avant la fin”

“le dernier à…”

“je teste X et à la fin je montre le résultat”

“objectif + contrainte” (ex : “avec 5€” / “en 24h”)

8) Plateformes = montages différents
TikTok : plus court, plus dense (10–20s souvent)

YouTube Shorts : un peu plus narratif (30–40s peut très bien marcher)

IG Reels : très visuel + sous-titres + partage

Si tu veux, je peux te faire :

ou 10 exemples de hooks “première frame” + “foreshadow” adaptés à ta niche (donne-moi le thème : fitness, business, food, etc.).

Maintenant tu peux traduire ça stp « I used to spend hours trying to plan a video and still have no idea what I was actually trying to say. I would make an outline, rewrite, scrap it, and start all over again. Or I'd skip it all and just start filming, hoping I would figure it all out in the edit. But then I'd be staring at a messy timeline with no clue what the story was actually supposed to be. I was overthinking, and totally getting lost in the details Until I started doing something so stupidly simple. .. I couldn't believe it actually worked. Five lines. That's it. And suddenly every story clicked. You know, most comments I get are about my storytelling. So today, I'll show you a little secret. Because when you've written down these five lines, you've got a blueprint to create a story and a script that actually makes people feel something to create something with a heart. you know, before YouTube. I ran my own video agency together with a friend, and we created all kinds of stuff, We did a lot of commercials. We made series, small documentaries, And, you know, I always loved to do crazy stuff, come up with crazy concepts weird transitions in a scripts. And I think it really made the, the advertisements and the videos we made a lot more awesome. But what I kept bumping into over and over again, it doesn't matter if you're alone or working with a big crew or doing YouTube. Filmmaking is a lot of decision making. And what happens time after time? That in this chaos of decision making... You're losing the core of the story. And this is a big issue, because the core of your story is one of the most important things. Because if you don't know what the story is really about, no editing trick or no camera trick is going to save you from that. So then how do you get clear what your story is actually about. Well that's where the five line story method comes in. So this is the method that I've been using to create almost all my story driven videos. The only thing you have to do is write five lines. So watch this. So your first line will be about the situation. That's the starting point. Where are we and what's happening. And how does the world look like where we're in The second line will be about the desire. So what does the character want? What does she want to obtain, or what does she want to reach? The third line is about the conflict. What gets in the way? Where’s is the tension or what is an obstacle that makes it hard to reach the desire? Then the fourth line is going to be about change. So what happens that shifts something This could be a turning point in the story. Something big or something small or just a different way of seeing something, And then the fifth and last line is going to be the result. So how does it end? What's the new reality and how is the situation different now from when we started. Now this might all sound very simple and easy. But believe me when I say that simple is good with filmmaking. Because these five lines will help you to see the whole story before you get distracted by everything else. By Gear. Transitions. Voiceovers. endless color grading, you name it. There are so many details and so many choices to be made. So if you nail these five lines first you've got the emotional core of your story. It's like the life thread. Now I'm going to explain you why this works so well. But first, I want to show you a little example of how even big Hollywood films use this structure for their movies. So let me show you with a story that you definitely know. The Lion King. Let's start with the situation. Simba is a young prince excited to one day rule the Pride Lands. The desire, he wants to prove he's brave and worthy of being a king. the conflict. After his father's death, Simba runs away, ashamed and afraid to face his past. Then the change. Simba grows up and with help from his friends and a vision from his father, Simba returns to confront scar and take his place as a king. And the result. He restores balance to the Pride Lands and steps fully into who he was meant to be. So obviously there's missing quite some details to make the story a little bit richer, but it is the whole story. And the funny thing is, once I started using this method, I started seeing this in every movie that I saw. And probably you will too now. Next time when you watch a movie, you will probably see the point where the conflict is introduced or where the desire is introduced. So I'm sorry if no movie will be the same anymore for you. But you know, it's not just the beginners trick. It's just how almost every story works. So now let's break down each line to see why it actually matters. The situation, where we are is very important because it gives the viewer a clear starting point of where we are, what's happening and who's in the story. They will know the world that we're in and what we're actually talking about. The desire that really shows the goal or the needs that's driving the story. And this usually really sparks the curiosity of the audience and this is the part where people will lean more into the story, and they start to care about whether you're getting the thing or not. The audience will start to feel invested in the story. And maybe the thing that the main character wants is something they want as well. So the third one, the conflict introduces tension or an obstacle. And this is really something that stories need. Because if there's no tension, if there's no obstacle, if there's no challenge, there's not really a reason to keep watching for the audience. So the fourth one is change. And this really marks a turning point in the story. So it could be an insight or an action or anything that shifts everything., you know It really shows growth and it gives the audience the feeling of movement forward. The fifth, result. So this should really give your audience satisfying take away a feeling of closure, an ending, and it should be something that ties everything of the whole story together. And it shows how the world or the situation or the character is different from the starting point. Together these five lines are just how we naturally process every story. So I'm going to show you an example of how these five lines actually play out in one of my own YouTube videos. But first, I want you to know that these five lines aren't your whole video. They are some sort of launchpad... You can use them to kick off your story and start building from your five lines, or you can use them to come back at any time when your project is overwhelming you to take a look again at your five lines and to see the things that you are building in your story, if you can connect them back to one of your five lines. Okay. So now I'm going to show you how one of my own YouTube videos that's over eight minutes long can be downgraded to just five lines. Watch this. I'm a filmmaker from the Netherlands and I've loved making videos since I was a kid. My dream was to be a YouTuber and sharing stories from the heart, not just for clients. But every time I tried to start, self-doubt and overthinking pulled me back. When I let go of the YouTube dream, I finally realized I was focusing on the wrong reasons and I just wanted to create stories. So I finally sat down and started, and this video is the result, and that first step pushed me to go all in on this YouTube journey. So that was basically the whole story of my first YouTube video in five lines. And now the cool thing is, when you can do it with five lines, you can do it with ten as well. Watch this. I'm a filmmaker from the Netherlands and I've loved making videos since I was a kid. My dream was to be a YouTuber and sharing stories from the heart, not just for clients. But every time I tried to start, self-doubt and overthinking pulled me back. My mind kept yelling, you can't go for making ads for big companies to making YouTube videos. Those fears became excuses: I'm too late and too old, I don't have enough skills. Gear. Security. So I let go of the big YouTube dream and at first it felt good and I felt free. But then the same question kept coming back: why did I actually want to do YouTube all the time? When I stripped away views, subscribers and money, I realized it's about the joy of creating and sharing stories. That realization made me push through self-doubt, focus on the process and the video you're watching right now is the result of that. It wasn't easy, but I already learned so much, and it even made me go all in on YouTube and share every lesson along the way. So going from five lines to ten lines doesn't change the core of the story. It just adds more richness and more details. And I could show you the 20 line version now as well. But I think you get the point. I could continue showing you more lines until I show you the whole video. So if you can do five lines, you can expand and expand more and create a whole story. So you've seen now how these five lines can help you to guide an entire video. But if you find it still really hard to create your own story driven videos or to finish them, or you just want to become a better storyteller by actually creating something instead of watching endless tutorials like this one. Then you could get my Story Starter Kit. It will help you to turn your five lines into an actual shotlist. It helps you to edit your story with my editing templates. And it guides you step by step with a video walkthrough with a lot of extra tips and inspiration. I just launched the Kit last month, so it's still available for a launch price. I think it's very affordable. And if it might be something for you, just check out the link in the description. And if not really not a problem. You can still use this method for your next project. So thanks for watching. And if you now want to know the nine only simple shots that I use to create any story with, you can watch this video next. »

Bien sûr — voici la traduction en français, fluide et fidèle au ton :

Avant, je passais des heures à essayer de planifier une vidéo… et au final, je n’avais toujours aucune idée de ce que j’essayais vraiment de dire. Je faisais un plan, je réécrivais, je supprimais tout, et je recommençais à zéro. Ou alors je zappais toute la préparation et je commençais à filmer, en espérant que je comprendrais tout “au montage”.

Sauf qu’ensuite, je me retrouvais face à une timeline en bazar, sans aucune idée de ce que l’histoire était censée raconter. Je réfléchissais trop, et je me perdais complètement dans les détails…

Jusqu’au jour où j’ai commencé à faire quelque chose d’une simplicité stupide. Et je n’arrivais pas à croire que ça marchait vraiment.

Cinq lignes. C’est tout.
Et d’un coup, toutes les histoires ont “cliqué”.

Tu sais, la plupart des commentaires que je reçois parlent de mon storytelling. Donc aujourd’hui, je vais te montrer un petit secret. Parce que quand tu as écrit ces cinq lignes, tu as déjà un plan : une “blueprint” pour créer une histoire et un script qui font vraiment ressentir quelque chose — créer quelque chose avec du cœur.

Avant YouTube, j’avais une agence vidéo avec un ami, et on créait toutes sortes de contenus : beaucoup de publicités, des séries, de petits documentaires… Et j’ai toujours adoré faire des trucs un peu fous : inventer des concepts dingues, des transitions bizarres, des scripts originaux. Et je pense que ça rendait nos pubs et nos vidéos bien plus cool.

Mais je me heurtais sans cesse au même problème — que tu sois seul, avec une grosse équipe, ou sur YouTube :
faire des films, c’est prendre énormément de décisions.

Et qu’est-ce qui arrive, encore et encore ?
Dans ce chaos de décisions… tu finis par perdre le cœur de l’histoire.

Et c’est un énorme problème, parce que le cœur de ton histoire est l’une des choses les plus importantes. Si tu ne sais pas vraiment de quoi parle ton histoire, aucune astuce de montage, aucune astuce de caméra ne pourra te sauver.

Alors comment devenir clair sur ce que ton histoire raconte réellement ?
C’est là qu’intervient la méthode de l’histoire en cinq lignes.

C’est la méthode que j’utilise pour créer presque toutes mes vidéos basées sur une histoire. Tu n’as qu’une chose à faire : écrire cinq lignes. Regarde.

1) La situation
Point de départ. Où est-on ? Que se passe-t-il ? À quoi ressemble le monde dans lequel on se trouve ?

2) Le désir
Qu’est-ce que le personnage veut ? Qu’est-ce qu’il veut obtenir ou atteindre ?

3) Le conflit
Qu’est-ce qui se met en travers du chemin ? Où est la tension ? Quel obstacle rend le désir difficile à atteindre ?

4) Le changement
Qu’est-ce qui arrive et qui fait basculer quelque chose ? Un tournant. Quelque chose de grand, de petit, ou juste une nouvelle façon de voir les choses.

5) Le résultat
Comment ça se termine ? Quelle est la nouvelle réalité ? En quoi la situation est différente de celle du début ?

Ça peut sembler très simple. Mais crois-moi : en cinéma, simple, c’est bien. Parce que ces cinq lignes t’aident à voir toute l’histoire avant de te faire distraire par le reste : le matériel, les transitions, les voix-off, l’étalonnage sans fin, etc.

Il y a tellement de détails et de choix. Donc si tu verrouilles d’abord ces cinq lignes, tu as déjà le noyau émotionnel de ton histoire — le fil de vie.

Maintenant je vais t’expliquer pourquoi ça marche si bien. Mais d’abord, je veux te montrer un exemple : même de gros films hollywoodiens utilisent exactement cette structure.

Prenons une histoire que tu connais forcément : Le Roi Lion.

Situation : Simba est un jeune prince, excité à l’idée de régner un jour sur la Terre des Lions.

Désir : Il veut prouver qu’il est courageux et digne d’être roi.

Conflit : Après la mort de son père, Simba s’enfuit, honteux et terrifié d’affronter son passé.

Changement : Simba grandit et, avec l’aide de ses amis et une vision de son père, il revient affronter Scar et reprendre sa place de roi.

Résultat : Il rétablit l’équilibre dans la Terre des Lions et devient pleinement celui qu’il devait être.

Évidemment, il manque plein de détails pour rendre l’histoire plus riche, mais… c’est toute l’histoire. Et ce qui est drôle, c’est qu’une fois que j’ai commencé à utiliser cette méthode, je l’ai vue dans tous les films que je regardais. Et toi aussi, tu vas probablement la voir maintenant.

La prochaine fois que tu regardes un film, tu repèreras sûrement le moment où le désir est introduit, ou celui où le conflit arrive. Désolé si plus aucun film n’est “pareil” après ça.

Mais ce n’est pas juste un truc pour débutants : c’est juste comme ça que fonctionnent la plupart des histoires.

Maintenant, décomposons pourquoi chaque ligne compte.

Situation : donne au spectateur un point de départ clair. Où on est, qui est là, et de quoi on parle.

Désir : montre le besoin / l’objectif qui pousse l’histoire. Ça déclenche la curiosité et l’investissement : le public commence à se demander si tu vas réussir.

Conflit : crée la tension. Sans obstacle ni défi, il n’y a pas vraiment de raison de continuer à regarder.

Changement : le tournant. Un insight, une action, un événement — quelque chose qui fait avancer l’histoire et montre la progression.

Résultat : donne une conclusion satisfaisante. Une fermeture. Et montre comment le monde / la situation / le personnage est différent du départ.

Ensemble, ces cinq lignes reflètent simplement la façon dont on traite naturellement une histoire.

Je vais maintenant te montrer comment ces cinq lignes s’appliquent à l’une de mes propres vidéos YouTube (plus de huit minutes). Mais d’abord, un point important : ces cinq lignes ne sont pas toute ta vidéo.

C’est plutôt un tremplin. Tu peux t’en servir pour lancer ton histoire et construire à partir de là, ou y revenir quand ton projet devient écrasant, pour vérifier que tout ce que tu ajoutes se rattache bien à l’une des cinq lignes.

OK. Voici comment une de mes vidéos peut être “réduite” à cinq lignes :

Je suis un vidéaste néerlandais et j’adore faire des vidéos depuis enfant.

Mon rêve était d’être YouTuber et de raconter des histoires avec du cœur, pas seulement pour des clients.

Mais à chaque fois que j’essayais de commencer, le doute et la sur-analyse me bloquaient.

Quand j’ai lâché ce rêve, j’ai compris que je me focalisais sur de mauvaises raisons et que je voulais simplement raconter des histoires.

Alors je me suis assis, j’ai commencé… et cette vidéo est le résultat. Ce premier pas m’a poussé à me lancer à fond dans YouTube.

Voilà : toute l’histoire de ma première vidéo YouTube en cinq lignes.

Et le truc cool, c’est que si tu peux le faire en cinq lignes, tu peux aussi le faire en dix.

Regarde :

Je suis un vidéaste néerlandais et j’adore faire des vidéos depuis enfant.

Mon rêve était d’être YouTuber et de raconter des histoires avec du cœur, pas seulement pour des clients.

Mais à chaque fois que j’essayais de commencer, le doute et la sur-analyse me bloquaient.

Mon cerveau criait : “Tu ne peux pas passer des pubs pour de grandes marques à des vidéos YouTube.”

Ces peurs sont devenues des excuses : “Je suis en retard”, “Je suis trop vieux”, “Je n’ai pas assez de compétences”, le matériel, la sécurité…

J’ai fini par lâcher ce grand rêve YouTube, et au début je me sentais bien, libre.

Mais la même question revenait : pourquoi est-ce que je voulais faire YouTube, au fond ?

Quand j’ai retiré les vues, les abonnés et l’argent, j’ai compris que c’était pour la joie de créer et de partager des histoires.

Cette réalisation m’a aidé à dépasser le doute, à me concentrer sur le processus, et la vidéo que tu regardes est le résultat.

Ce n’était pas facile, mais j’ai déjà énormément appris, et ça m’a poussé à m’engager à fond et à partager chaque leçon en chemin.

Passer de cinq à dix lignes ne change pas le cœur de l’histoire : ça ajoute juste de la richesse et des détails. Je pourrais te montrer la version 20 lignes aussi, mais tu as compris l’idée : si tu peux faire cinq lignes, tu peux développer et développer encore jusqu’à construire une histoire complète.

Tu as vu comment ces cinq lignes peuvent guider une vidéo entière. Mais si tu trouves encore ça difficile de créer des vidéos “story-driven”, de les terminer, ou si tu veux devenir un meilleur storyteller en créant vraiment au lieu de regarder des tutos sans fin…

Alors tu peux prendre mon Story Starter Kit. Il t’aide à transformer tes cinq lignes en shotlist, à monter ton histoire avec mes templates de montage, et te guide pas à pas avec une vidéo explicative, plus plein de conseils et d’inspiration.

Je l’ai lancé le mois dernier, donc il est encore au prix de lancement (je pense que c’est très abordable). Si ça t’intéresse, le lien est dans la description. Et si ce n’est pas pour toi, aucun souci : tu peux quand même utiliser cette méthode pour ton prochain projet.

Maintenant traduis ça en français stp « hey there storytelling is one of the most powerful tools to hook your listeners and keep them glued to every word you say but hey a lot of the advice that is out there make it sound way too complicated but the truth is storytelling is actually pretty simple if you know what really matters if you just give me 9 Minutes you'll discover the five storytelling techniques to tell insanely good stories but before we do that let me show you a quick example by John Kinski whom you might know from the office it's a 20 second story so really short but it's so powerful by the end of today you'll know exactly how to tell stories just like him and then I said yeah and he said says uh who are you visiting here I said my wife and he says is she an actress I said yeah he said would I know her I I don't know man her name's Emily Blunt he goes he goes you and I went yeah and he goes you you married Emily Blunt now I go yeah and he goes this okay go did you notice what he did there he didn't just summarize the events he didn't say oh yeah back then I was at customs and the agent asked me what I was doing and I responded I was an actor and he was very surprised he doesn't do that he doesn't summarize the events instead he zoomed into the moment of the story the best stories don't just summarize events they don't stay at that helicopter level they zoom into the moment they take us into the trenches they let us be part of that physical moment the good thing is it's not that difficult I'm now going to show you five techniques that you you can use in all of your stories first technique location say where you are the best stories start by stating the location where are you physically examples 2 weeks ago I'm sitting on my couch in my living room taking a deep breath or September 2019 I'm standing in front of the conference room ready to walk inside now why does it matter to State the location because the moment you say conference room or living room your audience will start to visualize it they're like o yes I I know a conference room and they start to visualize their version of that conference room now beginner storytellers they often do the mistake that they give too many details they're like oh in that conference room there was a big table a television and a wooden floor don't do that don't do that it doesn't matter just stay the location as long as they can visualize it it doesn't matter all the details they have their own version of that location second technique actions what are you doing in that specific moment of the story instead of giving way too much context about all the random stuff that doesn't matter just say what are you doing in that specific moment that can be walking biking shouting reading waiting whatever it is just State the actions State the verbs examples I'm in my office I open my laptop and start reading a message by my manager or 2 weeks ago I'm at the airport waiting and lineing at security now why does it matter to State the actions because it brings in forward momentum it takes the listener right into the moment when you do that your audience will immediately know that you won't waste their time you're straight away taking them into the most important part of the story third technique thoughts what are you thinking we as humans have thousands and thousands of thoughts every single day a lot of those thoughts are hopes dreams plans fears worries crazy thoughts now share some of those thoughts of that crucial moment of the story example instead of saying I was excited to meet my crush say I thought ah this will be so cool right finally I can see her after all that time or instead of saying I was very disappointed about that presentation say I thought oh man this is bad right everyone will think now I'm stupid I can never go back there do you see the difference it's a tiny tweak but it makes any story more interesting but hey a common mistake is that people share thoughts that sound too professional too intellectual they say something like I thought this represents a supreme opportunity now would your thoughts actually sound like that probably not right and so what you want to do is when you share your thoughts give us the raw unfiltered thoughts give us those a little bit like ranchy juicy a little bit neurotic thoughts now that will make your story much more relatable fourth technique emotions what are you feeling the best stories they're emotional they take the listeners on this emotional journey and now with the thoughts with the previous technique you know now one technique to make it more emotional but there's another one the simplest way is to just stay an emotion so you say something like I was disappointed I was relieved I was happy now that is pretty standard right that is what most people do but it's not ideal because it is not really visual right when you hear someone saying I was disappointed well you cannot visualize it and so the better way is to show the emotion show how it looks on the body on the face when you experience that emotion let me give you some examples instead of saying I was relieved say in that moment I lean backward and let out this big or instead of saying he was anxious say he kept tapping his pen on the on this table and he kept glancing up to the clock every few seconds do you see the difference showing the emotion makes it much more visual it takes us into the specific moment of the story technique number five dialogue what are you hearing many of your stories will have more than one character maybe a manager your friend a coworker your dog whoever it is now what did the character say in that crucial moment of the story what were the exact words examples instead of saying my friend was very disappointed say in that moment my friend looked at me and said Phillip what on Earth was that or instead of saying my manager was very happy with my work say in that moment my manager looked at me and said wow that was really the best presentation you've ever given now do you see the difference dialogue is such a simple tool to make any story much more interesting it is actually the tool that I use the most but I guess there's just one thing to keep in mind similar as with the thoughts share the dialogue that is a little bit more interesting a little bit more juicy if you say something like in this moment my manager said well I'm very dissatisfied with the inadequate execution of that project well that would sound super boring right instead pick much more juicy much more concise and catchy doll all right now that you know the five most important elements in storytelling let's watch a quick one minute video to see those elements in action that story is by Sarah Willingham who's a British entrepreneur investor and CEO of nightcap now when you watch the story see how she zooms into the moment can you spot when she shares the location the actions the thoughts the dialogue and the feelings so in my mid-20s I was running Acquisitions for pizzza Express and walked into a meeting room I was 2 minutes late for the meeting and the person on the opposite side of the table the lawyer looked up and said oh thank goodness for that mine's uh white with one sugar please so I thought okay this is a moment walked around to the coffee made him his coffee but the coffee in front of him and said would anybody else like a coffee and um nobody said anything nobody wanted one I made myself a coffee and then sat back down again opposite him and as he looked up I watched the C drain from his face as he realized this enormous assumption that he' made and it was such a beautiful moment in my career really empowering when I sat there and realized that actually this moment where I'd had impostor syndrome anyway running a meeting like this but I'd been completely misjudged by the people on the opposite side of the table was actually this incredible superpower cuz guess who walked out with the Dale what an incredible Storyteller right today you learned the foundations you learned how to tell insanely good stories but hey there are also a few more advanced storytelling techniques out there in case you want to go deeper on this journey I would suggest to check out this next video in which you learn how to be a better Storyteller than 99% of the people see you there »
ChatGPT a dit :
Bien sûr 🙂 Voici la traduction complète en français, fluide et fidèle au ton :

Salut ! Le storytelling est l’un des outils les plus puissants pour capter l’attention de ton audience et la garder accrochée à chaque mot que tu dis.
Mais soyons honnêtes : beaucoup de conseils qu’on trouve rendent ça beaucoup trop compliqué.

La vérité, c’est que le storytelling est en réalité assez simple, si tu sais ce qui compte vraiment.

Donne-moi 9 minutes, et tu découvriras les cinq techniques de storytelling pour raconter des histoires incroyablement efficaces.

Mais avant ça, laisse-moi te montrer un exemple rapide avec John Krasinski, que tu connais peut-être grâce à The Office.
C’est une histoire de 20 secondes seulement, mais elle est extrêmement puissante.

« Et là je dis oui, et il me dit :
“Qui venez-vous voir ici ?”
Je dis : “Ma femme.”
Il dit : “Elle est actrice ?”
Je dis : “Oui.”
Il dit : “Je la connaîtrais ?”
Je dis : “Je sais pas… elle s’appelle Emily Blunt.”
Et il fait :
“Vous… vous êtes marié à Emily Blunt ?”
Et je dis : “Oui.” »

Tu as remarqué ce qu’il a fait ?

Il n’a pas simplement résumé les événements.
Il n’a pas dit : « J’étais à la douane, l’agent m’a posé des questions et il était surpris. »

Non.
Il a zoomé dans le moment.

Les meilleures histoires ne restent pas à hauteur d’hélicoptère.
Elles plongent dans l’instant.
Elles nous emmènent dans les tranchées.
Elles nous font vivre ce moment physiquement.

Et la bonne nouvelle, c’est que ce n’est pas si difficile.

Je vais maintenant te montrer cinq techniques que tu peux utiliser dans toutes tes histoires.

Technique 1 : le lieu
Dis où tu es.

Les meilleures histoires commencent par le lieu physique.
Où es-tu exactement ?

Exemples :

« Il y a deux semaines, je suis assis sur mon canapé dans mon salon, je prends une grande inspiration. »

« Septembre 2019, je suis debout devant une salle de réunion, prêt à entrer. »

Pourquoi c’est important ?
Parce que dès que tu dis “salle de réunion” ou “salon”, ton audience commence à visualiser l’endroit.
Elle se crée sa propre version de ce lieu.

Erreur fréquente des débutants : trop de détails.
« Il y avait une grande table, une télé, un sol en bois… »
Non. Inutile.

Dis simplement le lieu.
Tant que l’audience peut le visualiser, ça suffit.

Technique 2 : les actions
Que fais-tu à ce moment précis de l’histoire ?

Au lieu de donner plein de contexte inutile, dis simplement ce que tu fais :
marcher, attendre, lire, courir, parler, etc.

Exemples :

« Je suis dans mon bureau, j’ouvre mon ordinateur et je commence à lire un message de mon manager. »

« Il y a deux semaines, je suis à l’aéroport, j’attends dans la file de sécurité. »

Pourquoi c’est important ?
Parce que ça crée du mouvement.
Tu amènes directement l’auditeur dans l’instant clé.
Il comprend tout de suite que tu ne vas pas lui faire perdre son temps.

Technique 3 : les pensées
À quoi penses-tu à ce moment-là ?

Nous avons des milliers de pensées chaque jour :
peurs, espoirs, scénarios, inquiétudes, pensées absurdes.

Partage ces pensées brutes.

Exemples :

Au lieu de dire « J’étais excité de la voir », dis :
« Je me suis dit : “Ça va être trop bien… enfin je vais la revoir.” »

Au lieu de dire « J’étais très déçu de ma présentation », dis :
« Je me suis dit : “Mince… c’est nul. Ils vont tous penser que je suis idiot.” »

Tu vois la différence ?

Erreur courante : des pensées trop professionnelles ou trop intellectuelles.
« Je me suis dit que cela représentait une opportunité exceptionnelle. »
Non. Personne ne pense vraiment comme ça.

Donne-nous les pensées crues, non filtrées, un peu irrationnelles.
C’est ça qui rend une histoire relatable.

Technique 4 : les émotions
Qu’est-ce que tu ressens ?

Les meilleures histoires sont émotionnelles.
Elles font voyager l’audience.

Beaucoup de gens disent simplement :
« J’étais heureux », « J’étais soulagé », « J’étais déçu ».
C’est correct… mais pas très visuel.

Une meilleure approche : montrer l’émotion.

Exemples :

Au lieu de dire « J’étais soulagé », dis :
« À ce moment-là, je me suis adossé et j’ai poussé un énorme soupir. »

Au lieu de dire « Il était anxieux », dis :
« Il tapotait son stylo sur la table et regardait l’horloge toutes les trois secondes. »

Montrer l’émotion rend l’histoire beaucoup plus vivante.

Technique 5 : le dialogue
Qu’est-ce que tu entends ?

Beaucoup d’histoires impliquent d’autres personnages :
un manager, un ami, un collègue, n’importe qui.

Que disent-ils exactement à ce moment clé ?

Exemples :

Au lieu de dire « Mon ami était déçu », dis :
« Il me regarde et me dit : “Philipp… mais qu’est-ce que c’était que ça ?” »

Au lieu de dire « Mon manager était content », dis :
« Il me regarde et me dit : “Waouh. C’était la meilleure présentation que tu aies jamais faite.” »

Le dialogue est l’un des outils les plus simples et les plus puissants du storytelling.

Attention : comme pour les pensées, choisis des dialogues vivants et concis.
« Je suis très insatisfait de l’exécution inadéquate de ce projet »… c’est ennuyeux.
Prends quelque chose de plus naturel et percutant.

Maintenant que tu connais les cinq éléments essentiels du storytelling, regardons une courte vidéo d’une minute pour les voir en action.

Cette histoire est racontée par Sarah Willingham, entrepreneure britannique, investisseuse et CEO de Nightcap.

Pendant que tu regardes, repère :

le lieu

les actions

les pensées

les dialogues

les émotions

« Vers la moitié de ma vingtaine, je dirigeais les acquisitions chez Pizza Express.
J’entre dans une salle de réunion avec deux minutes de retard.
L’avocat en face de moi lève les yeux et dit :
“Oh, heureusement… le mien est blanc avec un sucre, s’il vous plaît.”

Je me dis : “Ok… c’est un moment.”
Je vais faire le café, je lui pose devant lui, puis je demande :
“Quelqu’un d’autre veut un café ?”
Personne ne répond.

Je me fais un café, je m’assois en face de lui, et je regarde la couleur quitter son visage quand il réalise l’énorme supposition qu’il vient de faire.

C’était un moment incroyablement puissant dans ma carrière.
Je me suis rendu compte que cette situation, où je me sentais imposteur, était en réalité une force incroyable.
Et devine qui est sortie de la salle avec le deal ? »
